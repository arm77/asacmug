        <p>From now on, there will no longer be printed versions of
        the ASACMUG newsletter. We're going 100% electronic using
        the Web as our primary means to communicate with our
        members across the world.</p>

        <p>This is a short newsletter, primarily consisting of
        first-hand thoughts gathered during the San Francisco
        MacWorld Expo, January 7-10, 1997.</p>

        <p>In some respects, this expo represents the last, best
        chance for Apple to recover from the press harassment and
        negative publicity heaped upon it during all of 1996,
        exacerbated by any effective response on Apple's part and
        terrible marketing. Exceeding expectations, attendance at
        the expo increased to over 80,000, up 10% from the previous
        year. The mood, despite the recently-announced $120 million
        loss for Apple's first quarter, was also more festive than
        the last expo.</p>

        <p>The December 20th announcement of the Apple/NeXT merger
        provides the foundation upon which Apple will base its new
        operating system, codenamed Rhapsody. Thousands of
        attendees (at least those with the correct pink or yellow
        badges) saw CEO Gil Amelio in a marathon three-hour
        presentation of old and new technologies. The show was
        rambling, without any overriding theme, featuring
        celebrities Peter Gabriel, Jeff Goldblum, and others
        (although many thought that Frank Casanova gave the best
        demo). At the end, it was left to former CEO Steve Jobs to
        articulate Apple's strategy:</p>

            solutions only available from Apple.

        <p>He highlighted this by comparing the ability of DOS to
        build a one-story shack, the MacOS to build a 5-story
        house, and Windows NT to build a 7-story building. Under
        the OpenSTEP environment, a 20-story building is possible.
        This kind of thinking underlines the growing complexity of
        today's software; OpenSTEP promises the ability of "two
        people in a garage" to build applications that today are
        done by hundreds of programmers. He then did a short demo
        of NeXT's development environment (called the classic
        OpenSTEP demo by <a href=
        "http://www.lighthouse.com/">someone who knows</a>). At the
        end, both Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak were
        presented with the limited-edition <a href=
        "http://www.twentiethanniversary.apple.com/">20th
        anniversary Macintosh</a>.</p>

        <p>As I browsed the show floor talking to other attendees
        and exhibitors, I felt both pessimism and hope. Pessimism
        because the self-imposed deadline of one year to deliver
        Rhapsody is very aggressive. Apple must accomplish the
        following, any one of which is already a difficult
        task:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Make OpenSTEP run on PowerPC</li>

          <li>Merge MacOS services with OpenSTEP (eg. QTML, Open
          Transport, OpenDoc)</li>

          <li>Add symmetric multiprocessing</li>

          <li>Provide some compatibility with MacOS 7.X</li>

          <li>Support other Mac clones and the PPCP</li>

          <li>Convince developers to move to OpenSTEP</li>

          <li>Continue to develop MacOS 7.X</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, I have seen what OpenSTEP can do in providing
        the best development environment on any platform, the
        advanced OS features underlying a microkernel like Mach,
        and seeing a few NeXT applications (running on a Pentium no
        less!). In addition, there are a few things Apple has in
        its favor:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>MacOS services (QTML, GX, Open Transport,
          OpenDoc)</li>

          <li>MAE emulator technology</li>

          <li>A brilliant group of OS engineers led by Avadis
          Tevanian</li>

          <li>Mac and NeXT developers who want to create that
          20-story building
          <br />
          <br />
          and last, but not least -
          <br /></li>

          <li>Millions of customers who want something better than
          what Wintel offers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>They've got a tough year ahead of them, but as Gil
        Amelio said last year - "This is Apple, expect the
        impossible."</p>

        <p>As in previous years, I spent time roaming both the huge
        South Hall and the smaller North Hall, often stopping at
        the UGWUMP to rest, chat, and read my email. This year, to
        illustrate the co-dependence of Apple and its developers,
        the Apple Pavilion and Developer Central were next to each
        other. I spent some time in both - Developer Central was
        very good, although they should have provided more seminars
        and technical sessions for those looking for more detailed
        answers.</p>

        <p><b>Visual Cafe</b> - After losing the Mac development
        leadership to Metrowerks, Symantec is focusing on Java
        tools. They are doing a good job keeping their Mac and
        Windows versions equivalent. I understand why large
        companies like Symantec pursue a dual-platform strategy,
        but as a Mac advocate, I feel bound to support companies
        that are Mac-first or give every indication of supporting
        the Mac (such as Adobe). Nevertheless, Visual Cafe promises
        to greatly speedup Java development, with constant links
        between both visual and textual environments.</p>

        <p><b>UMAX</b> - The clone maker had dancing girls
        performing every hour. Some of us were repeat visitors.
        Umm, how much is that J700 in the window?</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.be.com/"><b>Be</b></a> - The Be
        booth was the second most popular booth (after Power
        Computing's). The BeOS runs on three different platforms
        (BeBox, PowerMacintosh, Power Computing). New BeOS
        applications were being shown, along with VirtualMac, a
        MacOS emulator with System 7.X compatibility, even with
        problematic applications like Word 6. Some people fear a
        "civil war" splitting Mac users' loyalties between the BeOS
        and Rhapsody, especially when the mass media had all but
        considered the Apple purchase of Be a done deal.
        <br />
        <br />
        BeOS has appeal to many of Apple's core customers in
        multimedia, while OpenSTEP has appeal to business and other
        developers. Still, this is a good thing - the enthusiasm
        and reasons for the Macintosh and what it represents should
        not be dependent on Apple's fortunes.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.c100.org/"><b>Component 100</b></a>
        - This consortium of OpenDoc developers provides solutions
        to prospective users, and provides marketing leverage and
        visibility not usually available to small developers. The
        demo of an OpenDoc database accessing data from Germany was
        quite convincing. I had bought the WAV word processor
        before the expo and the demos showed me that I didn't just
        buy a word processor, but a set of building blocks to do
        the work of the other 20 applications I'm currently using.
        With OpenDoc (finally) taking off, Apple is well-advised to
        make this work with Rhapsody from day one.</p>

        <p><a href=
        "http://www.mot.com/PowerPC/"><b>Motorola</b></a> - The
        Motorola booth was too slick. You could win great stuff,
        including a backpack, but you had to listen to an insipid
        presentation that tells absolutely nothing. Yes, the
        StarMax computers are good, and Motorola is shipping tens
        of thousands of units a month. However, they need a good
        education on what expo attendees expect. I was unable to
        get a single question answered by their booth
        representatives.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.mathsoft.com/"><b>Mathsoft</b></a> -
        I've had a love/hate relationship with Mathcad. They had a

        convey my <a href=
        "http://www.thesandbox.net/~arm/mathcad/">concerns</a> to
        their product manager at the time. However, I was later
        able to talk in detail with another product manager about
        their recent Mac version. I was told that their Mac
        development team consisted of <b>one</b> person. For a
        company that professes a committment to developing Mac
        software, this is not the way to do it. At least, they are
        selling more than they expected, so I hope that they will
        have enough incentive to fix their Mathcad bugs.</p>

        - The Mactivity fair was held the night before the Expo
        (Monday) at the Catehedral Hill Hotel on Van Ness and
        featured Internet and Web-specific vendors. The vendor fair
        ended with infamous columnist Andy Ihnatko hawking his new
        book which is a humorous look at new words created by the
        Internet revolution. Sorry, it's not as good as the jargon
        file, but provides a few laughs. At the end, Andy threw out
        some PEZ dispensers, then promptly shoved a 12-inch steel
        pin through his forearm - he definitely feels Apple's
        pain.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.bmug.org/">BMUG</a>/Microsoft - I
        went to this party (guess who paid) to hear <a href=
        "http://www.hurstad.com:80/dumpster52/applesec.html">Jef
        Raskin</a> speak. After seeing the line at the Cartoon
        Museum, our ASACMUG contingent decided that was better to
        stay outside if we wanted to breathe.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.apstech.com/">APS</a> - Another
        awesome hospitality suite hosted by the leading Mac
        peripherals (and now clone) vendor. They were giving out
        PowerBalls (can I have an 8-ball?) and showing their new
        products, which included a new enclosure, the ICCE thermal
        control system, and new Mac clones, including a 240-MHz
        black multimedia monster. It sports the "entertainment
        center" look popularized by PC companies like Toshiba and
        Acer. Our user group voiced some reservations about the
        Motorola design they are using, but again, I buy my
        peripherals from them all the time.</p>

        there, and one was on a lucky streak winning free software.
        Unfortunately, neither one won the Motorola StarMax grand
        prize (nor that week's lottery). At least the food was
        good.</p>

        a few hours. The recent New Year's flooding from the
        Sacramento Delta caused the surf to foam, but the air was
        refreshing, the sun was shining, the coffee was good, and
