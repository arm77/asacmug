        <h3><a name="lettereditor"></a>Letter from the Editor</h3>

        <p>This year's Macworld Expo was possibly the best expo in
        the last three years. This was the 10th Expo I've attended
        in a row, and although I've seen the Mac industry in better
        times, I've also seen it in much worse shape during the
        lean years of 1996-1998. This year's show was held in the
        context of the iMac's success, the million upgrades to
        MacOS 8.5, and continued Apple profitability.
        <br />
        <br />
        The announcements during the keynote only helped to
        reinforce that 1999 will be the year that Apple continues
        to grow and win both market share and mind share. Let the
        Mac market show the way towards a better computing
        experience, an experience the Wintel folks can only dream
        about.</p>

          will.</h3>

        <h3><a name="keynote"></a>Expo Keynote</h3>

        <p>The keynote was held on the morning of January 5th in
        the Expo User Conference rooms on the west side of Moscone
        Center. Due to the large crowds, an overflow conference
        hall between the South and North halls was used to transmit
        closed-circuit TV of the keynote. Unlike previous shows,
        only one keynote was delivered. This was done in order to
        focus all attention to Steve Jobs' presentation. I managed
        to get most of the keynote points by simply hanging near
        the back of the hall - the audio/video was pretty good
        considering the noise and crowds.
        <br />
        <br />
        Jobs speech focused on four "surprises" - the new PowerMac
        G3s, the premiere of MacOS X Server, the return of Mac
        developers to the game market, and the introduction of the
        new (Rev. C) iMac. Full details of the keynote are
        available at <a href=

        <p align="center"><b>Power Macintosh G3
        <br />
        New and improved</b></p>

        <p><br />
        According to Steve Jobs, the four major design goals of the
        new machines are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Most Powerful</b> - With the 233MHz iMac already
          faster than the 450MHz Pentium II, the new processor
          speeds of 300/350/400 MHz of the new G3s only increases
          Apple's performance edge over Wintel clones. When
          properly optimized on both platforms, applications such
          as <b>Adobe Photoshop</b> run much, much faster on a G3.
          Even when the MacOS version is not optimized,
          applications such as <b>Microsoft Office</b> still run
          faster MHz for MHz on a G3 compared to Intel machines.
          <br />
          <br /></li>

          <li><b>Best 2D/3D graphics</b> - It isn't simply enough
          that Apple match the PC industry in graphics speed and
          sophistication. Apple has always, <b>always</b>, had a
          lead in graphics, and the announcement that the new G3s
          will use the advanced ATI Rage128 chipset only
          strengthens the Macs graphics advantages. This chipset
          was co-developed by Apple and ATI. Although available on
          the PC side, it is optimized for the MacOS and leapfrogs
          the current 2D/3D Wintel leaders - the Voodoo3 and
          RIVA/TNT chipsets. Demos indicate that graphics speeds
          are between 20%-30% faster on a Mac 300MHz G3 than an
          450MHz Pentium II from Compaq.
          <br />
          <br /></li>

          <li>
            <b>Most Expandable</b> - Apple has decided to use
            industry standard features where they make sense and
            homegrown technology when the rest of the computer
            industry does not have a solution. Apple has chosen to
            use serial technologies in all their expansion ports in
            order to reduce costs and increase reliability The new
            G3 uses PC-standard 10/100 BaseT Ethernet for
            connectivity to existing networks and the Internet.
            Like the iMac, the new G3 has two USB ports for local
            peripherals.

            <p>However, for really high speed data transfer, Apple
            is the first company to ship computers equipped with
            dual FireWire (IEEE 1394) ports. These ports have
            transfer rates as fast as 400Mb/sec (50 Megabytes/sec)
            for use with digital video and other high-speed
            communications. Up to 63 devices can be attached to a
            FireWire bus, including other computers. This latter
            feature opens up interesting possibilities - small
            high-speed networks, two computers looking at hard disk
            as a local drive, multiprocessing of video and data
            streams. The possibilities are still being discovered
            (or at least implemented in hardware).</p>

            <p>During the keynote, Jobs took a video camera and ran
            its output first into one G3, and then into another G3.
            In a true demonstration of plug-and-play, he
            disconnected the cables a few times, and the FireWire
            network didn't even crash (Bill Gates wishes he had as
            much luck with Windows98 and a scanner).</p>
          </li>

          <li><b>Best Design</b> - The new PowerMac G3 comes in a
          distinctive case - not exactly the Bondi Blue of the
          first iMacs, but more like the new "blueberry" color of
          one of the new iMacs. Apple has decided to not change the
          name; the new machines are still called "Power Macintosh
          G3", but Apple is referring to them as "Blue-and-White"
          G3s. I couldn't help but notice that the side profile
          looks like a Apple command key. Like the iMac, the case
          is beautiful and makes people want to touch it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p align="center"><b>MacOS X Server</b></p>

        <p><br />
        Apple announced the February availability of MacOS X
        Server. Priced at $995 for a unlimited-client license, it
        is an attractive alternative to WindowsNT, offering all the
        advantages of a microkernel-based Unix system with the
        powerful features of both open-source software such as
        Apache and GNU toolset and (proprietary) Apple software
        such as the OpenStep development environment (Yellow Box)
        and WebObjects, a leading enterprise-level development
        environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, Apple has decided not to release a "lite
        workstation" version of MacOS X Server, partly to keep
        focus on the upcoming MacOS X which should be available
        later this year. At $995, it is targeted at the server and
        high-end markets. This is unfortunate as there is certainly
        a consumer market for a robust, modern operating system -
        just ask the folks at <a href=
        "http://www.linuxppc.org/">LinuxPPC</a> doing a great
        business selling a similar, but not as refined,
        consumer/server operating system for $32.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>Games, Games, Games!</b></p>

        <p><br />
        Jobs announced that at least 10 of the top-selling PC games
        will be available on the Mac. He then presented John
        Carmack, founder of Id Software. John, a games guru with a
        lot of influence in the PC world, announced full support of
        MacOS, promising the simultaneous release of Id Software
        titles such as Quake Arena on both PCs and Macs.
        <br />
        <br />
        Jobs then announced the biggest surprise of the show - the
        immediate availability of Connectix's Virtual GameStation
        (VGS). By emulating a Sony PlayStation for $49, the Mac
        game market just increased by 500 software titles. Although
        Connectix only guarantees that the VGS would only work on
        an Apple-branded G3, people have found that the biggest
        limitation is the motherboard bus speed rather than
        processor speed. Some non-Apple clones with a 60MHz system
        bus may be able to run VGS. See <a href=
        "http://www.powerwatch.com/">PowerWatch</a> message boards
        for details.</p>

             the undocumented mezzanine slot and infrared IrDA
             ports. <b>Who cares!</b> The biggest news is that the
             new iMacs comes in five new colors -</font> <font size=

        <h3><a name="showfloor"></a>On the Show Floor</h3>

        <p>I spent three days roaming the huge South Hall and the
        smaller North Hall. Even though the show space was slightly
        smaller than last years, the good use of curtains made it
        seem that the floor was actually crowded. Instead of large
        open spaces, the edges of the show floor were moved
        inwards. You knew this because the first aisle was #300
        instead of #100.
        <br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.linuxppc.org/"><b>LinuxPPC</b></a> -
        What was undoubtedly one of the more crowded booths, the
        uber-hackers of LinuxPPC were passing out free CDs of
        LinuxPPC 4.0, based on the latest RedHat 5.2 release. They
        also made two major announcements, the impending release of
        LinuxPPC 4.0 in February, and the release of the <a href=
        "http://www.applixware.com/">ApplixWare</a> office suite.
        The former will sell for $32, while the latter will cost an
        additional $100.
        <br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.connectix.com/"><b>Connectix</b></a>
        <b>VGS</b> - The announcement of the Virtual Game Station
        was certainly the Expo's most surprising event. The crack
        development team responsible for VirtualPC turned their
        efforts to emulate Sony's PlayStation game console.</p>

        <p><a href=
        "http://www.castlewoodsystems.com/"><b>Castlewood
        Systems</b></a> - This company introduced the Orb a year
        ago. Now, they have actually begun to ship the $199 drives,
        providing strong competition to Iomega's Jaz and the late
        SyQuest's SparQ. With 2.1Gb cartridges going for $30, they
        provide very low-cost storage. However, we will have to see
        whether the Orb's reliability and performance are as good
        as the hype claims them to be.</p>

        <p><b>Developer Central</b> - As usual, DC was the place to
        be to get the latest product news and software upgrades for
        the year. A few ASACMUG members visited the <a href=
        "http://www.fortner.com/">Fortner</a> and <a href=
        "http://www.metrowerks.com/">Metrowerks</a> booth and
        hopefully got both of them talking towards making a
        low-cost Fortran compiler for the Macintosh again. For many
        scientists and engineers, a Fortran compiler is still a
        requirement (admittedly, it is becoming less and less
        important), and the lack of an affordable one has kept the
        Mac from being a better scientific/technical solution.
        Credit goes to <a href="http://www.xplain.com/">Xplain
        Corporation</a> for putting together another great
        pavilion.</p>

        <p><b>Apple Booth</b> - To highlight the fact that Apple
        Computer is the center of the Macintosh ecosystem, this
        year's Apple Booth took <b>front and center stage</b> in
        the South Hall, unlike previous Expos where it was either
        in the North Hall or some other part of Moscone Center. It
        was laid out in three sections. One corner contained a
        large presentation <b>two-screen theater</b>, where Apple
        representatives talked about MacOS 8.5, the Yosemite Power
        Macs, the new multicolored iMacs, and passed out T-shirts
        to the enthusiastic crowd. The other corner contained
        rotating displays of Yosemite machines. All displays were
        on lighted tables, accentuating the beauty and form of the
        machines. People wanted to touch the case, look at the
        easy-opening access door. Other circular displays
        emphasized various technologies like FireWire, USB,
        ColorSync, WebObjects, MacOS X Server, and solutions geared
        towards Apple's core markets. Between the two sections was
        a large aisle filled with <b>multicolored iMacs</b> - there
        were enough of them so that you didn't have to wait more
        than a minute or two to get you chance to play with
        them.</p>
