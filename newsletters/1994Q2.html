        路路 NOTICE - PLEASE READ 路路</b></p>

        <p>This is our largest newsletter to date and printing the
        entire newsletter will require at least 25 pages. We
        encourage everyone to save a few trees and landfill space
        by reading the edition on your Macs and only printing out
        the minimal number of pages. If you must print, choose
        Print... from the file menu and a dialog box will allow you
        to print specific chapters.</p>

        <p>We are strongly considering going paperless by
        publishing only <b>non-printable</b> versions of future
        newsletters. To make it easier to read on a screen, we will
        increase the type size to 14 point Times (this paragraph
        and the previous paragraph). By going to a non-printable
        version, we will be able to publish longer and better
        articles, make better use of color, photographs, and allow
        Mac users to lead the way to paperless publishing. A
        printable version may also be available upon request and/or
        stored on our network BBS; such a version will minimize
        pages. Your comments, questions, and suggestions are
        strongly solicited and appreciated. Please reply via Email

        <p><b>Is it May Already?</b></p>

        <p>Even though it will be a little into May by the time you
        receive this newsletter, believe me, it is officially the
        March/April edition. We had a couple more items to include
        so it was delayed a few days. One of the items is the
        special offerings from Apple exclusively for user's groups.
        In addition, we're trying out a new, self-contained format
        for the newsletter; to switch between chapters, you select
        them from a pull down menu or use the left/right arrow
        keys. Let us know how you like it by addressing responses
        to ASACMUG. Again, DO NOT USE "REPLY ALL" or else you'll be
        sending mail to everyone on the mailing list.</p>

        <p><b>Special Discounts for MUG Members</b></p>

        <p>Many companies including Apple offer discounts for user
        group members on refurbished equipment. It is planned to
        pass along more information on these offers to members
        after being closely screened to limit communications to
        only better than average deals. Apple refurbished equipment
        ranges from to good to excellent deals depending upon your
        local market. Check out the deals and get your order in if
        you find something you want. Order forms are available on
        the ASACMUG BBS, or if you email ASACMUG, we'll be happy to
        send you a form and information. I'm particularly impressed
        with the deal on the Centris 610, since it is a good
        machine today, but can be upgraded to a 40 MHz PowerMac for
        less than $700 with an Apple PDS card or to a full blown
        PowerMac 6100/50 (8 mbs memory) with a full motherboard
        exchange for less than $1000. If you'd like additional
        information/opinions on a purchase, just email ASACMUG.</p>

        <p><b>A New Era for the Macintosh</b></p>

        <p>On March 15 of this year, the Macintosh began a
        transition to a new processor family called PowerPC, based
        upon a RISC processor architecture. The new processor is
        based upon the processor used in the IBM RS-6000
        workstations and offers the promise of a 3-10 times
        improvement in performance at a much lower price than the
        original 680x0 processors used since the original Mac in
        1984. During it's first month of sales, Apple claims to
        have sold about 145,000 PowerMacs making the new machines
        the fastest initial sellers in Apple's history. The PowerPC
        processor used in the Macs is also being used in IBM's low
        end workstations and will be used in a new generation of
        IBM PCs due to be released later this year.</p>

        <p>The PowerPC processor is a joint development between
        Apple, IBM, and Motorola and is the most serious threat to
        the Intel dominance of desktop computers since IBM
        introduced its first PC. Intel has the advantage of
        inertia, with over 80% of desktop computers using the Intel
        architecture. In addition, the very successful DOS/Windows
        operating system is closely tied to the Intel hardware.
        Although it is possible to run DOS/Windows on other
        hardware platforms under emulation, this requires a
        significant penalty in performance. The PowerPC has,
        however, the advantage of lower costs with equal
        performance compared to the Pentium, the current flagship
        of the Intel line. The first generation of PowerPC are
        based on the 601 and 603 chips. Current Power Macs use the
        601 chip, with cheaper and faster models (including
        PowerBooks) due later this year.</p>

        <p>The next generation PowerPC, based on the 604 chip, has
        already begun preliminary shipments to major customers
        (such as Apple). Systems based on the PowerPC 604, due
        early next year, will exceed the best Pentium performance
        by 50-100% (native mode) which will also allow it to run
        DOS/Windows application at Pentium speeds <b>in emulation
        mode</b>. This means that a potential Windows user, buying
        a high end machine, may face the dilemma of finding the Mac
        the better Windows platform (i.e. equal performance at a
        lower price) plus offer superior performance when running
        native Mac applications. If Windows NT ever catches on, the
        choice is even more clear since NT may run native (i.e.
        much faster) on a PowerPC at a lower cost.</p>

        <p><b>Okay, Okay, I bought a PowerMac!</b></p>

        <p>I've been impatiently waiting to upgrade my Mac for over
        a year. I bought my Mac II about six years ago, so I've
        waited a long time. I admit, I made several upgrades
        including memory, floppy disk drive, and a Daystar 40 mhz
        68030 accelerator. The old Mac operated at about Mac IIfx
        speeds, but ever before I got a Centris 650 at work, I
        wanted to upgrade. I decided however to wait for a PowerMac
        (which has been difficult). I got a great deal on a 16"
        Apple monitor last December but discovered that it would
        not work on my Mac II without a new video card costing
        several hundred dollars. Support for monitors up to 17" is
        standard on the PowerMacs, so I didn't want to buy a card I
        would not need in just a few months.</p>

        <p>Well, when the new Macs were introduced, I waited a
        little over month to study the machines, read reviews, and
        analyze trouble reports before buying. I concluded that the
        PowerMacs were very compatible with existing Mac software
        and that Apple had done a good job making the transition as
        seamless as possible. About 10 days ago, I took the plunge
        and bought the mid-range PowerMac 7100 (looks like a Quadra
        650) with 8 mb or memory, 250 Mb hard disk, and an internal
        CD ROM. The 16" color monitor worked perfectly, and I even
        used an old Nubus video card to drive a second monitor from
        my old Mac II. (Don't worry, the old Mac was not discarded,
        but quickly claimed by my wife for her classroom projects
        and general use).</p>

        <p>I plan to write a full article on the PowerMac next
        newsletter but here's a quick look of how things are right
        now. First, I have had almost no problems with
        compatibility running my existing applications and
        extensions under emulation. The only problems have been
        applications that require a floating point processor (FPU)
        such as MathCAD (I'll have to use the non-FPU version which
        comes with the program) and an old copy of Fastback II.
        Switching between emulation and non-emulation modes is
        handled automatically, the Mac determines whether the code
        requires emulation or not, and switches to the appropriate
        mode. The switch is so transparent that the Mac can switch
        between emulated and native codes within the same program.
        The user has to do nothing and simply runs his software as
        if it were a regular Mac.</p>

        <p>There is often confusion about "native" mode and running
        under emulation. Because the PowerMacs uses a totally
        different processor, the new computer cannot understand the
        instructions being issued by the existing base of software
        written for the older Motorola 680x0 processors. In order
        to run existing software, the PowerMac processor (PowerPC)
        emulates the older Mac's processor (680x0) using an
        emulator stored in ROM. To the software, it thinks it's
        running on a 680x0. This emulation requires a great deal of
        processing power, so the software does not run as fast as
        if the it was written specifically for the PowerMac.
        Fortunately, the PowerMacs are so powerful, that even under
        emulation, they run as fast as many existing Macs. Native
        software means that the software is specifically for the
        PowerMac and no emulation is needed; thus, software can run
        many times faster than under emulation.</p>

        <p>[One neat thing is that any PowerMac you buy will become
        much faster with time, as more and more of the operating
        system is converted to native mode (System 7.5, 7.8, and
        8.0), and as more people upgrade their existing software. -
        Ed.]</p>

        <p>Applications/extensions that I've run under emulation
        that seem to work fine include: MacWrite Pro, Word, Excel,
        MacMoney, Canvas, Dreams, Filemaker Pro, PowerPoint,
        American On-line, Quickeys, Hands-off, BBedit, Retrospect,
        Disk Doubler, Norton Utilities, and my own compiled
        QuickBasic applications. I haven't tried all of my programs
        so I'll have to report on them later.</p>

        <p>How fast is my PowerPC? That kind a depends what you're
        looking at. The finder is snappier than my old machine,
        particularly opening windows and scrolling. The emulated
        applications are generally about the speed of my old
        accelerated Mac which is about a Mac IIfx. My first native
        application is DeltaGraph which I was able to upgrade for
        only $10.00. This application screams and I'd estimate it
        is at least 5 times faster than my Centris 650 at work. I
        used to watch as the Mac would redraw a complex 3D contour
        plot taking many seconds. Although not instantaneous, if
        you blink, you'll miss it. It will probably take most of
        the summer for me to convert to mainly native applications,
        but I'm looking forward to it.</p>

        <p>My initial recommendation is that if you have anything
        below a Centris 610 and need more speed, this machine would
        be fine to get right now. It will run your existing
        software at least equal to what you're used to, and with
        each native application upgrade, the machine will scream.
        If you're already using a Centris class machine, you'll
        want to upgrade as soon as your most-used applications are
        available in native versions. By the way, although I'm not
        currently running the Window/DOS emulator, I've seen it run
        and it runs almost as fast as a 486SX-25 PC. I'll have more
        about this next issue.</p>

        <p>The <b>PowerMacs</b> are finally available in stores!
        I've scoured magazines (especially MacWeek) and newsgroups
        (especially comp.sys.powerpc) over the past few weeks to
        dig up all sorts of interesting tidbits of information
        about them, as well as about other things you might see
        from Apple in the future. I've tried to be as accurate here
        as possible, but be warned that some of this information
        might be completely wrong -- especially about products that
        haven't been released yet. Don't rely on what you read
        here; verify it first.</p>

        <p>Power Macintosh excitement has really been building ever
        since January's <b>MacWorld Expo</b> [covered in the last
        newsletter - Ed.], where the "PowerPC -- Get a life" pins
        worn by the Apple employees were countered by the
        occasional cry of "I don't want a life, I want a PowerPC!"
        from the crowd.</p>

        <p><b>What It Is and What It Isn't</b></p>

        <p>A Power Macintosh is basically just a Mac with a very
        different, very fast new chip -- the <b>PowerPC 601</b> --
        as its brain. The PowerMacs have been designed to be
        <b>100% compatible</b> with all other Mac hardware and
        software that runs on the rest of the current Mac line.
        (Whether or not they do turn out to be this compatible
        remains to be seen, but the word so far is that they do a
        wonderful job.) In fact, if you put a PowerMac 6100 and a
        Quadra 610 side-by-side and play with them for a while, you
        probably won't be able to tell which is which unless you
        peek at "About This Macintosh". The PowerMacs look the
        same, run <b>System 7.1.2</b>, and can use NuBus cards.
        They run 680x0 software at roughly the speed of a Quadra
        610 (25MHz 040) or a Powerbook 180 (33MHz 030), although
        I've heard claims that their speed can range on the
        extremes from a IIci (25MHz 030) to a Quadra 650 (33MHz
        040). You should be able to use all of your existing
        Macintosh hardware and software on a PowerMac at a very
        respectable speed without having to buy any upgrades.</p>

        <p>The real strength of the PowerMac, however, shows when
        you run "<b>native-mode</b>" software on it -- programs
        that have been recompiled to take advantage of the PowerPC
        chip inside it. <b>PowerMacs running native software are
        roughly two to four times faster than a Quadra 800</b>.
        Many companies are offering inexpensive upgrades to
        PowerPC-native versions of their software. The PowerMacs
        also provide speech recognition without requiring a DSP,
        and a lot of the performance-critical components in the
        PowerMacs support direct memory access (DMA) for an extra
        speed boost. The mid-range and high-end models can run two
        monitors at once without adding any extra hardware, and all
        three can be purchased with the "<b>AV option</b>", giving
        them all the video capabilities of the 660AV and 840AV.</p>

        <p><b>SoftWindows</b> comes bundled in with some PowerMac
        configurations; it runs DOS and Windows software at speeds
        approximating that of a 486SX/25. However, it only emulates
        a very fast 80286 chip, and therefore software that
        requires a 386 or a 486 won't run on it. (This means you
        won't be able to play Doom on it, unfortunately, but X-Wing
        ought to work fine.) <b>There should be a 486 version of
        SoftWindows ready later this year</b>. I haven't heard yet
        whether or not there will ever be SoundBlaster emulation
        for it, but the initial version can only simulate sounds
        coming out of a PC's internal speaker.</p>

        <p>The PowerMacs do not run Unix yet (except possibly for
        third-party Unixes that are available for other Macs right
        now). Taligent's object-oriented operating system, based on
        the PowerOpen standard, won't be available until probably
        1996. A/UX will not be available for the PowerMacs. I've
        heard that IBM's AIX operating system is being ported to
        the PowerPC's, but I don't know if that includes Apple's
        systems or not.</p>

        <p>The initial batch of PowerMacs aren't compliant with the
        current <b>PReP specification</b>. PReP (the "PowerPC
        Reference Platform") is a standardization that IBM came up
        with: any PC that has enough hardware to meet the
        requirements outlined in PReP will be able to run any
        operating system that is PReP-compliant. <b>This is what
        will allow future IBM PowerPC's to run AIX, Windows NT,
        Workplace OS (OS/2), Solaris, Taligent, and other operating
        systems.</b> However, PReP-compliant systems will probably
        not appear on the market until the end of this year. The
        PowerMac can currently only run Macintosh System 7.1 and
        emulate DOS and Windows 3.1, and future PowerMacs might or
        might not be designed to be PReP-compliant. The PReP
        specification isn't even in its final form yet -- it's
        scheduled to go beta in a few days, so developers couldn't
        conform to it even if they wanted to yet. One idea I've
        heard was that PReP might be modified so that this initial
        batch of PowerMacs are defined as "PReP-compliant", since
        they're the only PPC-based systems shipping right now
        (other than IBM's high-end PowerPC RS/6000 Unix server).
        We'll see what happens.</p>

        <p>The first PowerMacs also only support NuBus, although
        systems to be released next year (the "<b>TNT</b>" systems)
        will probably support <b>PCI</b>, allowing them to use the
        same boards that PCI-equipped IBM PC's can use.</p>

        <p>Another important thing to note is that, like all other
        Macs up to this point, the PowerMacs do not offer
        "preemptive multitasking" and "protected memory". They will
        continue to multitask cooperatively and run all
        applications in one memory space, and this might not change
        until 1996. (There's more information about this near the
        end of this article.)</p>

        <p>As with any other new computer system, I would
        *strongly* recommend quelching any "first kid on the block"
        instinct you might have and waiting a while before
        purchasing a PowerMac. <b>Beta-testing has proven them to
        be impressively stable systems</b>, but they need some time
        out in the real world to shake out any problems that might
        be hiding behind the faceplace.</p>

        <p>Why the weird naming scheme for the PowerMacs? Well,
        consider that the only other PPC-based system available
        right now is IBM's RS/6000 Model 250. Apple probably named
        their machines starting with "6100" to be one up on IBM's
        "6000". Go fig. :-)</p>

        <p><b>Pricing and Upgrades</b></p>

        <p>Here are the prices of the PowerMac systems, taken from
        Apple's press release. Note that these <b>do not include a
        monitor or a keyboard</b>. All prices given are in American
        dollars. [actual street prices are less and have fallen

        <p><b>A PowerPC PDS slot upgrade card</b> for 040 Macs
        costs <b>$699</b> and will double the speed of your system
        -- put it into a 25MHz 040 Mac, for example, and your
        system will effectively run at 50MHz. However, the PDS
        PowerPC card does not give your system the video options
        and other features that the full PowerMacs have. Upgrade
        cards are available from Apple for 040-based Macs with a
        full PDS slot: the Centris/Quadra 610, 650, 700, 800, 900,
        950, and the Apple Workgroup Server 60 and 80. Upgrades are
        planned for the Quadra 605, the LC 550, 575, and 520 and
        the Performa 550. There currently aren't any solid plans
        for upgrades from Apple for other models of
        Macintoshes.</p>

        <p>Third-party companies will be offering PowerPC upgrade
        cards for specific Mac models, but I don't have any
        information on those right now.</p>

        <p><b>Features and Configurations</b></p>

        <p>There are three models of PowerMacs. Here is the
        information that applies to all three of them:</p>

        </ul>

        <p>Here is specific information for each model:</p>

        <p><b>Power Macintosh 6100/60</b></p>

        <ul>

          monitor), stereo 16-bit sound input/output</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Power Macintosh 8100/80</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Quadra 800 case</li>

          <li>80MHz PowerPC 601 processor, 256k Level 2 memory
          cache</li>

          <li>8Mb RAM (expandable to 264Mb): 8Mb on the
          motherboard, 8 SIMM slots</li>

          <li>2MB VRAM (video memory), upgradable to 4Mb (see
          below)</li>

          <li>Ports: 2 serial, SCSI, ADB, 2 monitor (one for
          AudioVision display or standard monitor, one for standard
          monitor), stereo 16-bit sound input/output</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The <b>video options</b> need some explaining. In its
        base configuration, the 6100 has no VRAM slots, meaning
        that you have to run video off DRAM (regular RAM) just like
        the IIsi did. DRAM video tends to be rather slow. The 7100
        and 8100 support DRAM video as well, but each also comes
        with a VRAM card in its PDS slot with 1Mb/2Mb
        (respectively) of memory on it, upgradable to 2Mb/4Mb. This
        means that you can run two monitors on a 7100 or 8100
        straight out of the box. If you purchase the AV card, then
        that goes into your PDS slot on any of the three systems
        (replacing the VRAM card on the 7100/8100), and gives you
        2Mb VRAM (upgradable to 4Mb) and NTSC/PAL video in/out. The
        DRAM video port supports an AudioVision monitor (and
        "normal" monitors, too, I'd suspect); a VRAM or an AV card
        will give you a second monitor port (which supports
        "normal" monitors).</p>

        <p>Here is what various amounts of video memory will
        support:</p>

        <p><b>DRAM (using internal RAM for video):</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>up to 32,768 colors on a 14" monitor or smaller</li>

          <li>up to 256 colors on a 16" monitor</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>1Mb VRAM:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>up to 32,768 colors on a 16" monitor or smaller</li>

          <li>up to 256 colors on a 20" monitor</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>2Mb VRAM:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>up to 16.7 million colors on a 16" monitor or
          smaller</li>

          <li>up to 32,768 colors on a 20" monitor</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>4Mb VRAM:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>up to 16.7 million colors on a 20" monitor or
          smaller</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I'll say it again: many of the details given above could
        be flat-out wrong. Please don't make a purchasing decision
        based solely on what you read here!</p>

        <p><b>Future System Software</b></p>

        <p>While the PowerMacs are capturing the public's
        attention, Apple is hard at work on many other things. Here
        are a few of them:</p>

        <p><b>System 7.5</b> is due to ship this spring. There will
        only be one kit of it; gone will be the distinction between
        "System 7.1" and "System 7 Pro", and both the 68k and PPC
        versions of it will ship in one box. All of the elements of
        "System 7 Pro" and more will be rolled into System 7.5, and
        a new installer will only install the software that you
        have enough memory to run (it won't try to install
        Quickdraw GX on a system with only 4Mb of memory, for
        example). The Finder in System 7.5 will be fully
        AppleScriptable. The Apple Guide (formerly Apple Help) will
        come with System 7.5. When I saw it at MacWorld, it
        reminded me vaguely of the hypertext help that Windows and
        OS/2 provide, but the Apple Guide was organized *much* more
        clearly and thoroughly. Ask it how to do a task, and it
        will tell you the steps you need to follow. Ask it for more
        help, and it will circle in red magic-marker on your screen
        the things you need to click on. Say you need even more
        help and it will use AppleEvents to automatically guide you
        through the process.</p>

        <p>I haven't found anything about this in print, but the
        <b>Drag Manager</b> will probably also arrive with System
        7.5. It lets you select a range of text or a graphic in any
        window, and drag it into place in any other window or to
        the desktop (where it will appear as a "scrap"). I saw it
        at MacWorld and was duly impressed by it -- imagine the
        text dragging feature of Microsoft Word integrated into the
        system software. I've heard that it will allow dragging
        anything into anything else where that would make sense;
        for example, some applications will support having icons
        from the desktop dropped into their windows.</p>

        <p><b>OpenDoc</b> will probably arrive in System 7.8 later
        this year. OpenDoc does away with the concept of a document
        "belonging to" an application; you'll simply have various
        mini-applications that can work on different parts of your
        document. Your word processor will let you edit the text in
        your document, while your draw program lets you edit the
        graphics. If you want a better spell checker, then just get
        a better spelling checker application, and it will fit
        right in with the other application modules.</p>

        <p>The <b>Appearance Manager</b> will probably be part of
        System 7.8 too. I haven't seen anything about that in print
        either, but according to what I've heard, it will let you
        customize any part of the Mac's interface to look however
        you want it to look. For example, imagine a Macintosh that
        looks just like Microsoft Windows, all the way down to the
        menubars in the windows. So much for Windows users being
        afraid of having to learn a new operating system, or for
        Motif users complaining they hate the Mac's interface!</p>

        <p><b>QuickTime 2.0</b> will be released this summer. Its
        biggest feature is more speed: it will playback on an LC
        475 in a 320x240 window at 30 frames per second, or in a
        640x480 window at 15 frames per second (twice the speed of
        QuickTime 1.6). If you put an MPEG board in your Mac, it
        will let you play MPEG movies off a CD-ROM like several
        CD-I systems on the market can. (A CD-ROM can hold up to 1
        hour 14 minutes of full-screen full-motion video and
        CD-quality sound.) QuickTime 2.0 also lets you play a movie
        across a network (allowing for "interactive TV"), and it
        supports MIDI (for music playback) and SMPTE (to sync sound
        with video).</p>

        <p>Apple's new <b>microkernel architecture</b> (code-namd
        "<b>Gershwin</b>") is due to appear in 1996. This will give
        the Macintosh protected memory (meaning that when one app
        crashes, you can kill it and continue using your system
        without a reboot) and preemptive multitasking (meaning that
        the system will be more clever about partitioning its time
        out to applications that are running).</p>

        <p>The "<b>Macintosh Application Environment</b>" will be
        introduced on March 22. It lets System 7.1 and Macintosh
        68k applications run unmodified in an X window on Sun
        Solaris Unix and Hewlett-Packard HP-UX systems, with
        support for DEC Unix coming later. It works with any
        standard X window manager, including Motif and Open
        Look.</p>

        <p>That's all the information I have for right now (is it
        enough to keep you busy for a while?). Apple is maintaining
        a gopher server on "info.hed.apple.com" that contains all
        their press releases and will probably also have a lot more
        PowerMacintosh information in the very near future, so a
        watchful Mac user might want to keep an eye on it.</p>

        <p>I'll post more information here as I get it. Enjoy!</p>

        <p>What follows is a long e-letter I wrote on April 25,
        1994, to my friend Paul in Boston, who knows that a couple
        of months ago I gave up on Microsoft Word and began to use
        MacWrite Pro as my primary word processor--indeed, as
        virtually my only word processor. Paul knows that a few
        years ago I was very enthusiastic about Word, and he wrote
        to ask my opinion about MacWrite Pro. Here is my response.
        In a way this updates a document I wrote comparing MacWrite
        Pro and Word in April 1993 and uploaded last year.</p>

        <p>Let me make two things clear up front. First, I do not
        hate Microsoft Word. I have used it since 1985, constantly.
        I've written three books with it and started a fourth. I
        have urged folks to buy it in the past. I have written
        minimanuals explaining its use for the benefit of my
        colleagues at the University of Houston. It is a fine piece
        of work, no doubt about it. I liked the PC counterpart
        somewhat better, but let's not get started on that.</p>

        <p>Second, I do not work for Claris, not even as a
        beta-tester, nor do I own stock in the company. I do this
        only because (a) I think others might find this useful and
        (b) I obviously have too much <img src=

        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

        <p>Paul,</p>

        <p>Here are some tips concerning MacWrite Pro version 1.5.
        I have used MacWrite Pro for over a year now, and around
        Christmas 1993 (even before I got version 1.5) I finally
        began to regard it as my primary word processor. I now
        regard it as virtually my only word processor. Weeks go by
        now in which I do not launch Word. I will read the press
        releases when Word/Mac ver. 6 comes out. I'm betting on
        Spring 1995, although Microsoft swears it'll be out this
        summer. I think they have their fingers crossed behind
        their backs as they say it, but actually I don't give a
        darn if it comes out next week. Right now, unless it will
        write my papers FOR me, I doubt that I will shell out
        another $100 or so for an upgrade that will immediately lay
        claim to several megabytes of RAM and something on the
        order of 15Mb of disk space. What a dinosaur!</p>

        <p>In the rambling essay that follows, I update my
        "MacWrite Pros and Cons" essay of twelve months ago. First,
        I discuss MacWrite Pro's weaknesses (most of which are more
        apparent than real); then I enumerate MacWrite Pro's
        strengths or what I like about it; and finally, I give you
        a few tips on how to use it, tailored to the prejudices of
        a long-time user of Word.</p>

        <p><b>Cons</b></p>

        <p>There were lots of things that I missed from Word when I
        began to use MacWrite Pro heavily: a non-page-layout
        "Normal" view; the Ribbon; Word's glossaries; the ability
        to apply so many commands from the keyboard; and the
        ability to edit the menus and assign keystrokes to almost
        any command. I have gotten used to all of these things,
        surprisingly quickly. I hardly miss Word's Normal view at
        all. The ability to assign keystrokes to commands and/or
        edit menus is less important if the interface of the
        program is so well designed already that there are not many
        improvements or changes needed.</p>

        <p>Word's glossaries have been replaced by three things:
        the glossary functions of both Thunder 7 and Riccardo
        Ettore's "TypeIt4Me" shareware program, and by MacWrite
        Pro's Insert file command. I like TypeIt4Me, in fact, even
        better than Word's glossaries now. I occasionally miss the
        fact that Word's glossaries include formatting, but in
        general TypeIt4Me's glossaries are much easier to use.</p>

        <p>Word's Ribbon and Ruler are adequately replaced by
        MacWrite Pro's palettes, which in many ways are more
        intelligently laid out. (There are so many little quirks
        involved in the use of Word's Ribbon and Ruler. Using the
        Ruler's styles list to create a new style or modify an old
        one is easy once you've figured out how to do it, but who
        ever figured this out on his own?)</p>

        <p>I don't miss Word's outliner. It stunk. I was for a
        while one of its very few defenders, but in all honesty I
        have to admit that I almost never used it myself.
        ClarisWorks 2.x has an outliner, I understand, but I
        haven't used it. Joan needs an outliner occasionally, and I
        am wondering if upgrading to ClarisWorks 2 (we have version
        1) would be useful to her.</p>

        <p>I cannot honestly say that I miss Word's indexing tool,
        although I have an occasional need for such a tool, and
        MacWrite Pro does not provide one. However, one of the main
        things I have come to appreciate about MacWrite Pro is that
        it is not attempting to do everything. It is a great word
        processor, with many advanced functions. For writing books,
        it is inadequate in some respects. But I do not spend most
        of my time writing books. (MacWrite Pro 1.5 has a table of
        contents feature, but I have not used it.)</p>

        <p>There are exactly three things I do not like about
        MacWrite Pro:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>It is easier to move the insertion point around from
          the keyboard in Word. I regret that MacWrite Pro didn't
          take advantage of the numeric keypad the way Word does:
          the arrow keys are so awkwardly placed. (This complaint
          was remedied with QuicKeys aliases.) I miss being able to
          move by sentences (i.e. to jump from one period to the
          next period). I really do not like what MacWrite Pro does
          when you are selecting text from the keyboard and you
          overshoot your target. When you do this in Word or for
          that matter in FileMaker Pro, you can pull the selection
          back a word or a few characters as needed. But if you try
          to do this in MacWrite Pro, instead of pulling the
          selection back, you start expanding it at the other end.
          This is just stupid. This could only be useful to
          somebody who wants to select text from the middle of the
          target string.</li>

          <li>MacWrite Pro's Define Styles dialog needs an "Okay"
          or "Define" button. After you edit a style's formatting,
          you just click on inert white space somewhere. Somebody
          on Claris's normally brilliant interface team was out
          sick on the day this dialog was finished.</li>

          <li>Word offers more control over footnotes, note
          superscripts, and paragraph formatting of notes. I can
          live with MacWrite Pro's limitations here, but I miss
          Word's flexibility.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>That is it. Really. Okay, I might mention one more thing
        which is not very important to me. Overall, Word's table
        features are superior. I miss the way that Word's tables
        knew that I would probably want the text in row 4, column
        1, to be formatted the same way the text in row 3 of the
        same column was formatted. Adding another row to a column
        seems to challenge MacWrite Pro, which responds a bit
        reluctantly. My work does not involve lots of long tables,
        but if it did, this might be a factor weighing heavily in
        favor of Word. On the other hand, small tables are easier
        to create in MacWrite Pro and much easier to edit. Word's
        three-level ruler seems to confuse a lot of people. In
        MacWrite Pro, you can change the width of a column in a
        table by--get this--just dragging the column separator! Why
        didn't Bill Gates think of that? You can merge cells easily
        too, for some neat effects. My suspicion is that 90% of the
        users out there will find MacWrite Pro's tables actually
        better implemented and easier to use. The other 10% who
        need real table power will prefer Word or WordPerfect, and
        with good reason.</p>

        <p>There are a few things that I miss in MacWrite Pro.
        Occasionally I would like to be able to number a group of
        lines automatically. I can work around this pretty easily
        however with a section that has two columns, one of which
        is very narrow. In fact, such an approach gives me
        considerably more flexibility than Word's auto-numbering
        scheme. And of course I can view the line numbers on the
        page as I work (unlike Word).</p>

        <p>I miss Word's "hidden text" character format, because it
        made it possible for me to create footnotes whose reference
        numbers were not visible. (I used this all the time in
        Latin texts that I annotate for my students.) This is
        admittedly a very specialized need.</p>

        <p>There is nothing in MacWrite Pro to correspond to Word's
        "first page special" section format. You can indicate in a
        MacWrite Pro section that you want a title page, but what
        that means is that headers and footers will not print on
        that page at all.</p>

        <p>This last complaint, however, is instructive. At first,
        this lack of separate headers and footers for "title pages"
        struck me as a terrible failing of MacWrite Pro. I soon
        learned however how to compensate for this lack using one
        of MacWrite Pro's real strengths: text frames. You simply
        set up a text frame on page 1 of a section, and place into
        it whatever header or footer text you want. I am so used to
        this now that I actually prefer it.</p>

        <p>Another example of using a strength of the program to
        overcome a weakness. As I said, long tables are not
        MacWrite Pro's forte. Actually, no table can be very long
        in MacWrite Pro: a table is a type of frame in MacWrite
        Pro, and no frame can straddle a page break, so no table
        can be more than one page long. This can be somewhat
        inconvenient: it means that you have to regard tables more
        or less as graphic elements, rather than as continuations
        of your body text.</p>

        <p>Now Joan's paralegal had been using Word's tables to
        create summaries of documents and these were often more
        than one page long. I discovered a work-around that takes
        advantage of MacWrite Pro's superior section formatting. In
        MacWrite Pro, the columns in a multi-column section do not
        have to be the same width as they do in Word. Furthermore,
        there is in MacWrite Pro a "column break" character that
        you can use to force text in column 1 (say) of a
        three-column section to stop and jump up to the top of
        column 2. (I often wanted to do this in Word and couldn't,
        except clumsily, by inserting Returns.) With these features
        in mind, I came upon the idea of creating many short
        sections (each starting "next line" rather than "next
        page") with multiple columns of varying widths, and using
        these column breaks to move from column to column (instead
        of tabs, as in a table). I haven't created a ten-page
        document this way, and I fear that if I did it would be an
        inordinately large file for all the formatting involved,
        but it seems to work fine in some respects, better than
        using tables.</p>

        <p>In general, I have decided that MacWrite Pro deserves
        the name "pro" if you allow it to compete only in the word
        processing category, and do not require it to compete in
        the category of book-processing, which it is not designed
        for. (You may remember that Word back in version 3 or so
        began to call itself a "document processor" rather than
        word processor.) I have to say, however, that Word's book
        or document-processing skills are not all that great
        either--or all that necessary. University of Nebraska Press
        did not set the pages of my book from my Word files, as of
        course I did not expect them to. And if you *were* actually
        going to do page layout for a book, well, using a
        page-layout program rather than a "document processor"
        might be advisable. The only considerable advantage I can
        see to Word is its indexing function, and I am not planning
        to have need of that again any time soon. AND Mike Steiner
        on the development team for MacWrite Pro at Claris is
        working on an AppleScript script that will index MacWrite
        Pro documents.</p>

        <p><b>MacWrite Pro's strengths, or what I like about
        it</b></p>

        <p>Lots. Really. I like this program a lot. It is fun to
        use, most of the time. It reminds me of what I liked about
        the Macintosh when I used one for the first time in
        1985--when I wrote my first paper (an article on Horace) in
        MacWrite (version 4, I think). I feel like MacWrite Pro
        gets in my way much less than Word did. Using Word was like
        flying a commercial jetliner, while using MacWrite Pro is
        like driving a sportscar. If you need to move 150 people
        cross country, you need the jetliner. And flying a jetliner
        does give you a sense of power. My word processor's bigger
        than your word processor! But for ordinary running about,
        the sportscar is both more fun and more efficient. And if
        you get into the Zen of the thing, you can also begin to
        sense that MacWrite Pro's intelligence is a kind of power,
        but a more subtle, civilized kind. Sure, you can't expect
        to do color separations, create a fully-functioning
        spreadsheet with graphs, or compose music in MacWrite Pro.
        But if you want to kern a couple of letters, you have no
        alternative. Neither Word nor WordPerfect offers true
        kerning. To me it boils down to how much you care about
        text.</p>

        <p>I like working in any number of reduced views. I work at
        80% a lot. If my default font is Palatino 12, the type
        onscreen is quite legible, and I can view over two-thirds
        of a page. I have to go down to 70% or so to view an entire
        page on screen at once.</p>

        <p>MacWrite Pro's frames are infinitely easier to work with
        than Word's and I use them all the time, especially the
        text frames. Placement, editing, text-wraparound, and the
        rest--MacWrite Pro beats the heck out of Word in this
        department. Today I created a piece of stationery for
        printing 30 small Avery labels. Every label was a frame:
        there was no actual text in the document at all. The
        document had one, three-column section, and there were ten
        label-sized frames in each column of the page. Doing this
        in Word would have been a nightmare.</p>

        <p>MacWrite Pro's "variables" are more flexible and much
        easier to use than Word's glossaries for page number, date,
        time, etc. It is easy in MacWrite Pro, for example, to have
        a footer showing the page numbers in this format: "Page x
        of y" where "y" is the total number of pages in the
        document. MacWrite Pro has a variable that shows you the
        last time a document was modified, which I am now making
        heavy use of. Variables are a good example of the
        intelligence of MacWrite Pro's interface. Word's variables
        are glossaries. To view the date glossary options, you have
        no choice but to go into the glossary list and scroll
        through them. They are numerous, to be sure, but also
        somewhat bewildering, and they are in a list with the
        glossaries for times, pages, versions, and several other
        things.</p>

        <p>MacWrite Pro's variable options appear to be less
        numerous than Word's but only because they are so
        unobtrusively provided for you. You get to them in the Edit
        menu via the "Insert variable" pop-out. Date is one of the
        options. Normally you just pull over to "date" and MacWrite
        Pro inserts the date, formatted as you have previously
        specified in your Preferences file. However, you can
        override the default format by holding down the Option key
        while you pull down to this command (or while you type the
        keyboard command). This brings up a little dialog that has
        three options for you to choose among:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Format: 4/25/94 or April 25, 1994, &amp;c.</li>

          <li>Order (for 4/25/94 format): mm/dd/yy, dd/mm/yy,
          yy/mm/dd</li>

          <li>Update: never, always, when modified, next open</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All in all, this produces TWENTY-EIGHT permutations. And
        Word? Word has exactly seven date glossaries. Hmmm.</p>

        <p>Text handling? Forget the competition. MacWrite Pro
        offers letterspace justification. It doesn't kick in always
        or immediately, but it kicks in when its needed. For
        working with narrow columns of text especially, this is
        imperative. In a narrow column of justified text, Word will
        leave a gap at the end of a line that contains a single
        word. MacWrite Pro on the other hand will distribute the
        slack among the characters within that single line.</p>

        <p>MacWrite Pro's kerning and character space options are
        without parallel. This is admittedly a somewhat esoteric
        feature. But I absolutely love it. It's what attracted me
        to MacWrite Pro initially more than anything else.</p>

        <p>Character styles are useful, although it has taken me
        some time to understand how and why, and I haven't quite
        mastered them yet. One use I make however is this: I create
        two character styles called "Default" and "Latin." Latin is
        exactly like Default (say, Times 12) except that Latin has
        the Language attribute "None." When I start to type some
        Latin, I just type Option-Command-2 to switch to the Latin
        character style--and then MacWrite Pro's spelling checker
        does not beep at me after every word. When I'm done with
        the Latin text, typing Option-Command-1 puts me back into
        my default, which has the Language attribute "U.S. English"
        and thus invites spell-checking.</p>

        <p>MacWrite Pro's autosave and automatic backup options are
        excellent, superior to Word's.</p>

        <p>Printing? How about back-to-front printing--something
        Word should have gotten around to years ago, but hasn't
        yet. Also you can collate pages if you print multiple
        copies of the same document.</p>

        <p>(One weakness of MacWrite Pro here: You cannot specify
        that it print an individual section of a multi-section
        document. You cannot print just the current selection,
        either. However you can SAVE the current selection, which
        you cannot in Word. This is a toss-up.)</p>

        <p>Finally, I very much like the fact that MacWrite Pro is
        fully scriptable. AppleScript and OSA are clearly the way
        of the future. Big applications like WordPerfect and Word
        that do everything you can imagine wanting to do with your
        computer and some things you cannot, are the way of the
        past. I think this "bigger is better" neurosis goes back to
        WordPerfect for DOS. DOS was such a pain to deal with that
        the average user was abjectly grateful for a program that
        did things like file management, printing envelopes and
        labels, and so on. But that was then and this is now. With
        any luck, Microsoft's domination of the Mac word processing
        market will end with Word 6. Power Mac users are already
        checking out WordPerfect, which has the only nativized
        Power Mac word processor on the market. But WordPerfect 3
        clearly is NOT "it." MacWrite Pro may be "it." The the
        thing I like about MacWrite Pro most of all is its graceful
        self-confidence, its lack of pretension or ostentation.
        This may be a marketing weakness, I am afraid. MacWrite Pro
        could add a few features without selling its soul, but it
        could not start touting those features the way Word and
        WordPerfect do. MacWrite Pro's greatest strength is
        precisely that it does NOT rub your nose in all its power.
        It is there to serve you, not to challenge you. People who
        look to their word processor to provide life's next big
        challenge need to get outdoors more.</p>

        <p><b>Conclusions</b></p>

        <p>I think the rest of the program can be figured out by
        any Mac user with prior word processing experience. When
        you get the software, look at the manual. In general I
        think it is excellent. And when you don't find the answer,
        let me know or contact Claris Tech Support on Compuserve.
        The folks they have answering questions on CIS are about
        the best I've ever seen represent a company. Good luck.</p>

        Power Macintosh</b>
        <br />
        by Lyle H. Nishida
        <br />
        Seattle, Washington</p>

        <p>Of all of the application software for the Macintosh,
        perhaps the biggest performance hog of all is Adobe
        Photoshop.</p>

        <p>Well guess what? Adobe has released a free Plug-In to
        get started with the PowerMacintosh.</p>

        <p>From Adobe's "read me" file enclosed with the
        Plug-In:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Adobe Photoshop 2.5 was engineered to ensure maximum
          productivity with future acceleration technology. To this
          end, the user-interface code was isolated from the
          image-processing "engine" code that performs pixel
          manipulations. The PowerPC Accelerator plug-in replaces
          the entire Photoshop image-processing engine with a
          native engine. Using this plug-in, Photoshop users with
          Power Macintosh computers should realize speed gains of
          1.5 - 4 times over a Quadra computer (for in-memory
          images).</p>

          <p>This plug-in speeds all built-in Photoshop functions
          on the Power Macintosh, such as effects, resizing,
          rotating, compositing, feathering, color conversion, and
          all built-in filters including the Blur, Blur More,
          Gaussian Blur, Motion Blur, Add Noise, Despeckle, Median,
          Sharpen, Sharpen More, Sharpen Edges, Unsharp Mask,
          Emboss, Facet, Find Edges, Fragment, Mosaic, Trace
          Contour, Custom, High Pass, Maximum and Minimum
          filters.</p>

          <p>The accelerator does not, however, accelerate plug-in
          filters, such as the Color Halftone, Crystallize, Wind,
          Wave, Sphereize, Extrude, Twirl, Tiles, and Pointillize
          filters. Similarly, the PowerPC Accelerator does not
          affect third-party plug-ins, such as Aldus Gallery
          Effects and Kai's Power Tools. Note that the Lens Flare
          filter currently does not work on the Power Macintosh.
          Adobe Systems will post an update to this filter when it
          is available.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Essentially what it does is take all of the built in
        filters and process them in Native mode on the Power
        Macintosh. When I tested it on a Power Macintosh 7100 vs. a
        Quadra 840av the Gaussian Blur function was about 2 times
        faster. I surmise that since the PowerMacintosh 8100 is
        about 150% faster than the 7100 there would be a comparable
        gain there too!</p>
