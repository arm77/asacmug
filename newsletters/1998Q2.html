        <p>Any excuse to come up with a newsletter... This is a
        short writeup on installing Microsoft Office 98 for the
        Macintosh. Since AlliedSignal has a site license for MS
        Office products, I was allowed to install a copy on my home
        computer, provided that it does not get used during
        business hours, when I would be using MS Office on my
        trusty Centris 650.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yeah right.
        <br />
        <br />
        MS Office products are second rate, and the current release
        is no exception. Since many decide to use Office anyways, I
        feel that I should at least give some instructions on how
        to install the product on people's computers at work and at
        home.</p>

        <h3><a name="1998Q2_assets/mso98"></a>Configuring MS Office
        98/Mac</h3>

        <p>The very first thing you should know is that MS Office
        requires a PowerPC processor and a CD-ROM drive. Those with
        680X0 series machines, from the Mac Plus up to Quadra
        840AVs/950s, need not apply. Although the recommended
        processor speed is 120MHz, MS Office will install on any
        PowerPC machine. However, I did not check to see if it
        would r un on 680X0 Macs equipped with PowerPC upgrade
        cards.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="1998Q2_assets/mso_1.gif"
             width="309"
             height="322"
             align="right"
             alt="MS Office Root"
             border="0"
             hspace="5"
             vspace="5" />As mentioned in the last newsletter, MS
             Office 98 for the Mac offers many features and
             improvements over their previous 4.2.X version. When
             the CD-ROM mounts on the desktop, you see the
             following folders on the left. The top folder is the
             drag-install folder, while the bottom folder is the
             custom-install folder.
        <br />
        <br />
        The drag install is just that - simply drag the
        <b>Microsoft Office 98</b> folder to your hard disk. The
        use of self-reparing and first-run applications make sure
        that you have the proper files in your System Folder
        whenever any of the MS Office products is launched.
        <br />
        <br />
        The custom installer is similar to more traditional Mac
        software installers (the install engine is licensed from
        Mindvision) and will allow you to specify a "light" to a
        "heavy" installation, which can easily exceed 300
        megabytes!
        <br />
        <br clear="right" />
        The best approach is to bypass the custom installer and
        just do a drag install. This will move about 400-500 files
        totaling about 72 megabytes to your <b>Microsoft Office
        98</b> folder. If you still have additional room, you can
        choose to use the Value Pack installer and select from a
        huge list of options. The Value Pack folder weighs in at an
        amazing 288 megabytes, although some of that space is taken
        up by free MacOS system updaters. It is recommended that
        the proper MacOS updater is applied before installing MS
        Office:</p>

          </table>
        </center>

        <p>There are two other folders in the above picture. The
        <b>Microsoft Internet</b> folder contains installers for
        the Internet Explorer 4.0 web browser and the Outlook
        Express 4.0 email client. My advice is to skip these two
        products. Not only do they contribute to system
        instability, but there are other products that do a better
        job. I recommend using <a href=
        "http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a> Navigator 4.05 for
        web browsing and <a href=
        "http://www.eudora.com/">Eudora</a> Light 3.1 for email;
        both of these are also free from the Internet or company
        servers. If you want to use Outlook Express, be sure to get
        the latest version from the Microsoft web site.
        <br />
        <br />
        The <b>Value Pack</b> folder contains an installer that
        lets you add additional features to MS Office. The various
        components that can be installed are shown below. They
        include various options such as extra assistants, clip art
        (pictures and movies), MS Office Manager, tutorials, and
        other utilities and translators.</p>

        <p>Asking yourself what to install within your disk space
        budget is a good question. I did not want to lose another
        150 megabytes of disk space to things that I may not use,
        so I decided to only install certain features. At first, I
        decided to see how much disk space I would need if I
        installed what <b>I</b> wanted. I decided to take
        everything and justified why I <b>did not</b> need a
        specific feature.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Bookshelf Integration</b> - I don't own MS
          Bookshelf</li>

          <li><b>Data Access</b> - I have no need to query remote
          databases</li>

          <li><b>Genigraphics</b> - I don't need to use their
          services (PowerPoint slide making)</li>

          <li><b>MS Office Manager</b> - it has always been
          unstable, even this version</li>

          <li><b>Proofing Tools</b> - I only wanted the English
          version</li>

          <li><b>Programmability</b> - I did not plan on learning
          Visual Basic for Applications</li>
        </ul>

        <p><img src="1998Q2_assets/mso_3.gif"
             width="492"
             height="661"

        <br />
        <br />
        As you can see, I only had 144 megabytes of disk space
        left, and my wish list would have taken most of it. What is
        not mentioned is that the above option will place an
        additional <b>3000+ files</b> on your system (<b>Clip
        Art</b> being the biggest contributor). So, I was forced to
        start over and reduced my choices to the following. Going
        through the info boxes on the right side, I fould out that
        the <b>Assistants</b> took up a lot of space, each one
        being between 500k to 3 megabytes. However, since they are
        a nice feature of Office, I decided to keep some of the
        smaller and funnier ones. I decided to forgo <b>Business
        Tools and Templates</b> since I already had many of these
        under ClarisWorks or <a href="http://www.nisus.com/">Nisus
        Writer</a>. <b>Clip Art</b> was the largest module, since
        it contained all the clip art from previous versions of
        Office (especially PowerPoint) and also many QuickTime
        movies and photos; I decided to only keep those clip art I
        found interesting or useful like dividers and symbols. I
        kept the <b>Equation Editor</b> and <b>Excel Add-Ins</b>
        since I do a lot of number crunching and engineering
        analysis, <b>Fonts</b> to ensure compatibility with the
        Windows world, and <b>Movie</b> so I can use QuickTime.</p>

                <p align="center"><b>I find it interesting that
                even though Microsoft professes support of
                QuickTime, Movie is an optional install.
                Drag-install users are thus discouraged from using
                QuickTime in their documents.</b></p>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </center>

        <p>I selected <b>Text Converters</b> so I can import/export
        to other word processor formats. I chose <b>Unbinder</b>
        since there is no Mac equivalent of MS Office Binders under
        Windows. If you were to get a Binder file, you need this
        program to break it up into smaller pieces that can be
        loaded into Word/Excel/PowerPoint. Finally, I chose <b>Word
        Speak</b> because I want my computer to talk.
        <br />

             border="0" />
        <br />
        <br />
        As shown above, I managed to get my custom modules down to
        <b>under 50 megabytes</b> and about <b>900 additional
        files</b>. I retained most of the functionality I wanted,
        with emphasis on number crunching, technical documents,
        compatibility (font and file format), and exploration of
        new features (assistants and some clip art).

        <p>When you launch any MS Office application for the first
        time, it checks to make sure all the necessary files are
        present. This requires the installation of three megabytes
        of shared libraries that will be installed in your
        Extensions:MS Library folder when MS Office first starts
        up. On my PowerCenter Pro 210, initial (first-time)
        launches took between 30-40 seconds.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, subsequent launch times are <b>6 seconds</b> for
        Word and PowerPoint, and <b>3 seconds</b> for Excel, which
        is very comparable to the Windows versions.
