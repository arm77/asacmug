        <h2>A New Millennium</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The new century brings with it a resurgent Apple
          Computer. Our favorite computer company enters 2000 with
          a strong and impressive product line, over three billion
          dollars in cash, a high stock price, lots of new
          software, loyal customers, and a confidence that it will
          survive for a long time to come.
          <br />
          <br />
          Nevertheless, Apple has still not recovered to the point
          that it can even begin to think about re-entering the
          business/Fortune 500 market. As a corporate user group,
          we are disappointed in this but realize that Apple has
          more important priorities. Maybe soon enough, the new
          Internet e-conomy will cause a fundamental shift.
          Tomorrow's Fortune 500 will be dominated by those
          companies that embrace human and computing diversity
          instead of standardization and dull homogeneity
          Hopefully, Apple will be one of them.
          <br />
          <br />
          During 2000, Apple should be in a position this year to
          expand MacOS markets, whether themselves or through
          others. The rise of Linux, the recent decision against
          Microsoft, and the convergence of computing and
          entertainment makes it a very exciting time for those of
          us not in the Wintel orbit.
          <br />
          <br />
          Apple's products next year include - finally - the
          release of MacOS X, cheaper G4s, hopefully pushing the
          600-700 MHz range, better/faster/cheaper iBooks and
          iMacs, and a mobile and Internet strategy. Most
          importantly, Apple is one of few companies that keeps the
          computing world interesting and relevant. Apple's
          industrial design has spread from computers to other
          products - telephones, stationery, calculators,
          magazines, and even cartoon strips. The iMac is not just
          a computer, but the style for the next decade.</p>

        <h2>1999 ASACMUG highlights</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>We had four off-site lunch meetings in April, July,
            October, and December with off-site ASACMUG members
            Roger, Ming, and Dick. <a href="1999lunch.html">A good
            time was had by all</a> (it was a buffet - the grease
            you eat is the grease you choose!).
            <br />
            <br /></li>

            <li>Our Torrance Art Department finally got a G3
            server, which is now the fastest FTP file server in the
            company. It beat a $7000 a dual-processor NT server and
            a $15,000 HP-UX workstation. No matter what the IS
            staff did to their NT box, it just couldn't beat the G3
            in performance, reliability and cost.
            <br />
            <br /></li>

            <li>Tracy ordered his G4/500, was downgraded to a
            G4/450 by Apple, and as of mid-November, he hasn't
            gotten it yet.
            <br />
            <br /></li>

            <li>Alex ordered an iBook from <a href=
            "http://www.outpost.com/">Outpost</a>, then cancelled
            it once he actually got a <a href=
            "http://www.imacintouch.com/ibookfirst.html#oct09">chance
            to play with one</a>.
            <br />
            <br /></li>

            <li>Mike and Matt got DSL service, Julie has cable, and
            Alex is still waiting for his DSL line.
            <br />
            <br /></li>

            <li>Ron who has three 21-inch monitors at work, has
            looked at all what Apple has to offer and has decided
            to get a quad-processor G5.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>ASACMUG In Transition</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>As usual, we will be having our regular lunch/dinner
          get-togethers at Macworld. This time, it will be during
          the first and second days of the show (Tuesday, January
          5, and Wednesday, January 6). As a special event, the
          ASACMUG treasury will be officially depleted during this
          Macworld. Since we are not allowed to spend it at the
          Market Street Cinema, we will instead have some nice
          after-dinner mints.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thereafter, ASACMUG will undergo a name change, as the
          <a href="http://www.alliedsignal.com/">company</a> that
          we work for merges and takes on the name of the <a href=
          "http://www.honeywell.com/">company</a> being acquired.
          Our Mac Users' Group will continue to be a corporate and
          personal resource for all things Mac. Future activities
          and events will rely on the goodwill and support of its
          members and volunteers.
          <br />
          <br />
          As part of this change, the ASACMUG web site will be
          redesigned next month. This is also a good time to cease
          publication of the ASACMUG Newsletter. It was a valuable
          resource before the Internet, but in recent years has
          become nothing more than a yearly Macworld reminder and
          wrap-up.</p>

          <p>Thanks for all the fish. See you online.

            <font size="4"><b>If we claim that the Macintosh is a
            revolution, then our actions must translate into a
            force for change or else what good is a revolution?

            <br />
            <font size="4"><b>Anyone who studies the peculiar
            community surrounding the Macintosh would have to admit
            that there is something astonishing going on. Our
            little family shares a unique history of individualism,
            a tradition of fighting for what we believe in and a
            bond than transcends almost all social boundaries. We
            have made the Macintosh a vehicle for such a cultural
            phenomenon that the computer itself has become less
            important than the principle we share. The Macintosh
            Way is more than a slogan, it is, in essence, a
            philosophy of life and a statement about quality that
            transcends computers. If we all lived The Macintosh
            Way, it might be a better world.</b></font>
