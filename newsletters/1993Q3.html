             Your Data?</b>

        <p>The use of IBM pre-formated floppies in Macintoshes is
        believed to be responsible for many instances of corrupted
        data in ASE Engineering. The symptoms are that the disk
        seems to reformat properly and work satisfactorily but will
        suddenly become unusable. In most cases, the data has been
        recovered using Norton but in a least one instance, the
        data was lost.</p>

        <p>It is believed that the problem is that the Macintosh
        SuperDrive is not able to completely eliminate the heavy
        pre-formatting and that the traces that remain corrupts
        data written on top of them. The best advice is to avoid
        pre-formatted IBM floppies wherever possible. Where this is
        not possible, try reformatting the disk at least three or
        four times before using. Multiple reformatting is not a
        necessarily a cure but it cannot hurt. In ASE Engineering,
        either unformatted or Mac formatted floppies are being
        ordered in addition to the IBM formatted disks. Be sure to
        ask for the right preformatted disks for your machine. (For
        those in ASE Engineering, the Mac-formatted disks are
        availabe from Pie Reed or Bob Jamarillo in the Convex
        mainframe room, Bldg. 36, Level 0)</p>

             Saver</b>
        <br />
        Adam Engst (from TidBITS)

        <p>This set of After Dark modules from Berkeley Systems
        should be an instant hit with Star Trek fans, what with
        modules like one that displays detailed technical
        information from "Scotty's Files," a Starfleet Final Exam
        that you can actually take, a Planetary Atlas manual,
        displays of various ships panels, a display of the
        tunnelling Horta, a screenful of tribbles, and Spock
        walking around messing with things. In this respect,
        there's little wrong with the $40 package.</p>

        <p>To play the devil's advocate, I can't recommend Star
        Trek: The Screen Saver to anyone who isn't a serious Star
        Trek fan. Sure, the graphics are the correct licensed
        versions, as are the sounds, but too much of the package
        feels like a grade B remake of "Captain Kirk Meets The
        Flying Toasters." In some ways, the fact the hokey graphics
        aren't a problem; much of the original show's sets were
        equally as crude. However, I think the displays suffer from
        translation into another medium - like cartoons of TV shows
        or stuffed animals based on comic-strip characters, they
        always feel slightly wrong.</p>

        <p>Overall, then, Star Trek: The Screen Saver is a must for
        the serious Star Trek fan, but not necessarily appropriate
        for your average After Dark module collector. Note that
        unlike the More After Dark module package, After Dark
        itself (and the MultiModule and Randomizer modules) comes
        with Star Trek: The Screen Saver. This is convenient and
        also convinces me that Berkeley correctly identified their
        audience. Berkeley Systems -- 75300.1376@compuserve.com</p>

             id="anchor390258"></a><b>ASACMUG BBS Grand Opening</b>

        <p>A common activity of Macintosh user's groups is the
        maintenance of an electronic bulletin board system (BBS).
        The BBS is a focal point for exchanging information between
        between users. Here, files and messages are stored for
        members to download (transfer from the BBS to their own
        computer) and upload (transfer to the BBS from the
        members). The files may consists of system software, public
        domain/shareware software, informational articles,
        databases, graphics, and even forms or templates.</p>

        <p>Traditional BBS's are accessed through telephone lines
        by way of modems and dedicated telephone lines, BBS
        software, a dedicated computer, and storage space as a
        minimum. Callers also require a modem and appropriate
        telecommunications software. An important issue is long
        distance costs if the BBS and caller are at distant
        locations. This did not seem feasible for ASACMUG,
        particularly if ASACMUG wanted a graphical users interface
        (GUI); going back to a command line interface seemed almost
        anti-Mac.</p>

        <p>After great consideration, a network BBS using Apple
        System 7 file sharing seemed the near perfect solution. The
        GUI software was part of every Mac and using the
        AlliedSignal network eliminated the need for discrete
        modems. As a bonus, the transfer speed is much higher than
        even the fastest modems. Unfortunately, only hub sites can
        access the BBS but this is much better than serving only
        members who are local and have access to a modem. I believe
        the hub locations include Torrance, Arlington, Dallas,
        Morristown, Paris, and Tokyo. If there are other sites that
        can see our BBS, let me know.</p>

        <p>To access the BBS do the following:
        <br /></p>

        <ol>
          <li>Select Chooser from under the Apple Menu.</li>

          <li>If you do not see AppleTalk Zones, you cannot access
          the BBS so stop here.</li>

          <li>Select AppleShare and the zone marked
          "TOR-ASA-ENG-ETHERTALK".</li>

          <li>Select the file server called "Engineering KeyServer"
          and click "OK"</li>

          <li>Sign-on as a guest and double click on
          "ASACMUG&nbsp;BBS". Do not check the box to the right of
          ASACMUG&nbsp;BBS or you will be automatically logged on
          to the BBS every time you restart.</li>

          <li>You should now have the volume "ASACMUG&nbsp;BBS" on
          your desktop near you hard disk icon. Open it and you'll
          be on the BBS. The BBS volume operates like any other Mac
          hard disk, you copy files by dragging them to your own
          hard disk.</li>

          <li>To disconnect from the BBS, drag the
          "ASACMUG&nbsp;BBS" icon to the trash.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Once your open the BBS volume you will see areas
        including our software library which includes some Apple
        system software (up to 7.0.1) and authorized extensions and
        additions. There is also a collection of PD/Shareware
        software and other useful items. An important folder is our
        IN basket where you can submit items for posting to the
        BBS. You can also submit questions and the user group
        "experts" will try to help you out. We'll also have an area
        where you can see the questions asked as well as responses.
        If you can contribute to the question or answer, drop a
        message into the MUG in basket and so we can add it the
        Q&amp;A section.</p>

        <p>One last items regarding the BBS and the information
        from the user's group in general. We will assume that
        everyone has access to Microsoft Office software so files
        may be in either Word, Excel, or Powerpoint format. Files
        may also be self-contained which will require no other
        software. For fonts, please try to have both Times and
        Helvetica in your system. If you need either of these
        fonts, they are available from the BBS in the fonts
        folder.</p>

        <p>Finally, what about members who cannot directly access
        the BBS over the network. We're going to try to
        occasionally send a catalog of the BBS through the mail to
        members. They may then order items that they need through
        the mail.</p>

             id="anchor391578"></a><b>E-mail Comes to ASE
             Engineering</b>

        <p>For several months now, the Macs in engineering have had
        E-mail using their own mail server located on the zero
        level of Bldg 36. The Macs will not only be able to send
        messages and files within engineering but will also be able
        to communicate with other Macs and other E-mail system
        within AlliedSignal worldwide. Since the Mac is the
        predominant platform for Marketing/Field Sales, direct
        communication with AS offices in places such Europe, Asia,
        Australia, and all over the United States via the wide area
        network (WAN) is not uncommon. The WAN also includes
        gateways to PROFS, most of the E-mail systems within
        AlliedSignal, Internet Mail, and even a FAX service.</p>

        <p>The E-mail system is a valuable resource for ASE
        engineering in general and Mac users in particular. Kevin
        Elwell, ASAC Field Sales, stated that E-mail has been an
        invaluable tool for field sales and will be even more
        valuable with the addition of ASE engineering access.
        Elwell expects that better communications with engineering
        will result in better response times and thus better
        customer satisfaction.</p>

        <p>At the present time almost all of the Macs in
        Engineering have the client software installed with the
        remainder expected to be completed soon. A training session
        on the E-mail system was conducted last month by Earick
        Ward of ASAC. Engineering personnel can request access from
        Kelly Berger of ASE Engineering. Email access for those
        using PCs is scheduled for completion by April 1994.</p>

        <p>The E-mail system has already demonstrated its value on
        the Hermes program which is a joint effort between ASE and
        AlliedSignal Germany. Rapid document transfers between the
        two locations were being accomplished by a long distance
        telephone link using modems for file transfer at both ends.
        Due to the time difference, the transfers required extended
        workdays at both ends to provide a time overlap since both
        Macs had to be operated concurrently. The transfers
        required 20-40 minutes of time due to inconsistent levels
        of line quality and 2400 bps modems. The last exchange was
        accomplished by attaching the files to an Email message
        transmitted from the Frankfurt sales office directly to the
        ASE Engineering mail serve. This required just a few
        minutes during the California early morning hours where it
        was available at the start of the business day.</p>

        <a name="anchor392106"
             id="anchor392106"></a><b>IBM Mainframe access via
             Ethernet</b>

        <p>The Financial Shared Services (FSS) IBM mainframe in
        Tempe, Arizona is now accessible via the corporate network.
        The mainframe allows access to many programs from around
        the company, one of which is electronic expense reporting.
        All of us were (hopefully) trained a few months ago but had
        limited opportunity for a hands-on tutorial. Using the FSS
        program reduces paperwork and gets you that check
        sooner!</p>

        <p>Currently, only Macs directly connected to the corporate
        TCP/IP network can use this service. Access for LocalTalk
        Macs is currently not available; we hope to have this
        capability by the beginning of next year.</p>

        <p>To run the program, a 3270 terminal emulator is
        required. A good 3270 emulator is available on the
        ASACMUG&nbsp;BBS, courtesy of NCSA. To obtain the software,
        logon to the ASACMUG&nbsp;BBS as Guest and copy the tn3270
        [[florin]] folder to your hard disk.</p>

        <p>Open the folder and double-click on the tn3270
        application. You may have to type cmd-O to open a
        connection. In the Host Name: text field, type the IBM's IP
        address (137.19.80.9). Press return and you should be
        immediately connected to the IBM mainframe. All 3270
        functions are available from the keyboard or menu bar.</p>
