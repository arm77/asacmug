        <p>Welcome to another ASACMUG newsletter which is a dead
        giveaway that we're going to have another meeting. It's
        been a long time since our last general meeting but the
        user's group has not been totally inactive. Core group
        meetings have been held almost every week during the lunch
        period. Current plans are to extend the lunch meetings to
        include more members in the months to come. If anyone is
        interested in participating in the core group meetings,
        you're very welcome.</p>

        <p>During the January, 1993 MacWorld show in San Francisco,
        at least seven MUG members attended representing both the
        user's group and ASE unofficially. Attending the event were
        Tracy Johnson, Roger Wright, Alex Morando, Ron Keating,
        Dick Lerner, yours truly, plus one other member who
        attended incognito. If you've never attended a
        MacWorld,plan to attend this coming January, the 10th
        anniversary of the Mac, where Apple is expected to
        introduce the new PowerPC. Check with anyone who has
        attended and they'll tell you that its awesome.</p>

        <p>Our next meeting is scheduled for Thursday, May 27 at
        4:30 PM. The meeting will feature a video on how GAPD
        utilized the Macintosh and Quicktime in their manufacturing
        area. This will be followed by a visit from CompUSA and
        Apple Computer who will present their lastest desktop
        Macintoshes, the Centris 650, Centris 610, and the Mac LC
        III. CompUSA will also present a special employee purhase
        plan for Apple products available to all AlliedSignal
        Employees during the month of June at their Torrance store.
        Prices are well below street prices and are an excellent
        opportunity to purchase a new or updated system. For a
        preview of the prices, check out the pricelist on the back
        of our meeting notice.</p>

        <p>Prior to the user's group meeting (4 PM), there will be
        a short training session covering the engineering
        Appletalk/Ethertalk network plus use of the just installed
        Macintosh software /email server. The server will allow
        sharing of a wide variety of software plus give user access
        to ASAC sales offices worldwide. Anyone wishing to attend
        is welcome at ether the training session or user's group
        meeting which will immediately follow.</p>

        <p>The emphasis of this month's newsletter is electronic
        communication which will be one of the most exciting and
        expanding areas in personal and business computing. If you
        don't have a modem for your personal Mac, you're missing
        out. With 2400 baud data/fax modems going for around $100,
        there is little not to get involved. We'll be having more
        on this is future activities.</p>

        <p>Bye for now, see you at the meeting!</p>

        Dup+</b>
        <br />
        By Ron Keating, ASACMUG

        <p>What is the first thing we all do whenever we acquire
        any new software? We duplicate the original floppy disks!
        Duplicating disks is one of the most common chores for a
        Mac user. For several years, I did this the hard way. First
        I formatted the a disk and then I would drag the entire
        contents of the original disk to the newly formatted disk
        using the finder. This involved a lot of disk manipulation
        and caused me to buy a second, external floppy disk drive
        from Applied Engineering to speed up the process. Even
        after all of this work and expense, the copied disks did
        not always work properly, because they weren't exact
        replicas of the original. Because of this, I was sometimes
        forced to install programs from the original diskettes.</p>

        <p>Then, last year at the Los Angeles Macintosh Group's
        MacFair LA '92, I discovered one of those indispensable
        little programs that does one thing, but does it very well.
        I like this type of software; it's DiskDup+, a $20
        shareware program written by Roger D. Bates. Because it is
        shareware, it can be copied and passed on to anyone to use,
        under the understanding that they are to evaluate the
        program and determine whether to discard it or pay for its
        continued use. I picked it up on a shareware disk put out
        by LAMG for $5.00.</p>

        <p>The thing I use DiskDup+ for is to duplicate floppy
        diskettes with sector duplication from 800K or 1440K
        masters on to 1440K copies. I have standardized on the
        1.4MB diskette size, but most software still comes on the
        800K size. The new diskette is an exact, sector by sector,
        copy of the original! DiskDup+ formats the new disk (if
        required), warns you if there is anything on the new disk
        that will be written over, and performs a complete read
        back of the copy to verify all data against the original in
        order to insure full data integrity. Any number of copies
        can be made and a new master may be read in at any time
        without exiting the program. The time consuming Anti Virus
        scan is avoided because the Master disk is never mounted
        and therefore viruses can never propagate onto the master
        (and its copies) during the duplication process. It is even
        faster than using two floppy disk drives and the Finder
        copy.</p>

        <p>Operation is a no brainer: launch DiskDup+; it asks you
        for the Master. Insert the Master, it reads it, ejects the
        disk, and asks for the Copy. Insert the Copy and it
        formats, copies, verifies, and ejects the disk and asks for
        a new Master. All of this happens very quickly!</p>

        Questions--Answered</b>
        <br />
        By Tom Pitts, MUG News Service

        <p><b>Q</b> -- I started with a Mac Plus just last year and
        I want to upgrade. I am planning to buy an SE/30 with
        8&nbsp;MB RAM and a 100&nbsp;MB internal hard disk. I'll be
        using standard programs for spreadsheets, word processing
        and graphics -- nothing really fancy or exotic. I am
        uncertain whether I should use System&nbsp;7 instead of
        system&nbsp;6.0.5 which I have been using. What do you
        advise?</p>

        <p><b>A</b> -- There is no doubt about it, System&nbsp;7 is
        the current and future system software for the Mac. It is
        much more powerful and, with the System&nbsp;7 Tuner
        extension (available from user groups and electronic
        information services such as America Online), System&nbsp;7
        performs well, albeit somewhat more slowly than
        system&nbsp;6.0x. Since you will have a Super Drive, i.e.,
        a floppy drive that accepts 1.44&nbsp;MB floppy disks, get
        version 7.0.1 -- it is available only on the high density
        floppies. If you want better speed, use SpeedyFinder7 cdev,
        System&nbsp;7 Pack!, and/or FinderEdit to turbo-charge and
        customize your system. These great shareware programs are
        available from user groups as well as electronic bulletin
        boards, just like System&nbsp;7 Tuner. You can use ResEdit
        to improve your system software, but I don't recommend that
        route for a beginner. By the way, I don't care what you've
        heard or read elsewhere, you need at least 4&nbsp;MB of RAM
        to use System&nbsp;7 effectively. What you plan to buy will
        be fine with System&nbsp;7.</p>

        <p>[A disk fragmentation question has been removed for
        brevity - Ed.]</p>

        <p><b>Q</b> -- I'm lost. I have a bunch of fonts, some are
        TrueType some are Type&nbsp;1 taken from AOL and the Disks
        of the Month. How are these fonts different, how do I use
        them and which is best?</p>

        <p><b>A</b> -- The Mac needs two types of information about
        fonts. It must know how to display the font on the screen
        and how to print it. TrueType fonts contain both types of
        information in a single suitcase file. They look nice on
        the screen and the printed page no matter what type size
        you use. Because they are in a single file they are easy to
        use -- just install them into the System file. Under
        system&nbsp;6.0.x use Font/DA mover to install a TrueType
        font. With System&nbsp;7, open the suitcase file by
        double-clicking it, and drag the font file that is inside
        the suitcase into the System Folder. It will be placed in
        the System file for you.</p>

        <p>Type&nbsp;1 fonts have two parts -- the screen
        information and the printer information, often referred to
        as the screen font and the printer font, respectively. The
        printer font contains all the information, written in a
        format called PostScript, that your printer needs to print
        that font at any size. It is a "system extension" and is
        stored in the Extensions Folder within the System Folder.
        (With system&nbsp;6.0.x, it is placed in the System Folder
        itself.) Laser printers have some built-in printer fonts so
        you don't need to have those printer fonts in the System
        Folder too. Read your printer manual to determine which
        fonts are built in.</p>

        <p>The screen font is in a suitcase file. Each screen font
        file contains the information for only one type size. You
        should install a separate screen font for every type size
        of a particular font that you will use. If you select a
        type size for which you do not have a screen font
        installed, the Mac will use the printer font data to
        approximate that font on your monitor. It will look pretty
        bad on screen. (It will print fine because the printer uses
        the printer font not the screen font.)</p>

        <p>When you get a Type&nbsp;1 font that is not built in the
        printer, put the printer font into the System Folder.
        Install the accompanying screen fonts it in the System file
        just as you would do for a TrueType font.</p>

        <p>Some printers, like the ImageWriter, don't read
        PostScript files, so they cannot use Type&nbsp;1 fonts.
        Don't despair. If you want to use them on a non-PostScript
        printer, get Adobe Type Manager. It translates the
        PostScript printer fonts for your non-PostScript printer.
        The output isn't as clean as that from a laser PostScript
        printer, but it beats the ImageWriter alone. ATM also
        smoothes out fonts on the screen so you don't need to
        install every size screen font available. So even if you
        have a laser PostScript printer, if you use a lot of
        Type&nbsp;1 fonts ATM will improve your screen images and
        save disk space.</p>

        <p><b>Q</b> -- What should I do when my mouse freezes? Some
        people tell me to unplug the mouse from the Mac then plug
        it back in. I've heard that isn't safe. What's right.</p>

        <p><b>A</b> -- You heard right. Never unplug any peripheral
        from the Mac while its power is on. Sure, I understand. The
        Mac froze and if you restart it, you'll lose your unsaved
        work. But unplugging the mouse or keyboard is not the
        answer.</p>

        <p>If you're using System&nbsp;7 there is a possible
        solution. Say the mouse freezes while you are in one
        application and you have unsaved work open in another
        application. You can't rescue any unsaved work in the
        frozen application. Sorry. You might be able to save the
        work in the background application. Depress the Command,
        Option and esc keys simultaneously. If you are lucky you'll
        get a dialog box asking if you really want to "Force Quit"
        the application. Click on the "Force Quit" button. Once the
        frozen application has quit, go to the other, open
        application(s), save your work and quit all applications.
        Restart your Mac before you attempt any more work.</p>

        <p>If you cannot force quit the application, depress the
        restart button or turn the Mac off then back on. You'll
        lose all of your unsaved work this way but it's safe.</p>

        <p>Learn a lesson from this experience. Save frequently!
        Command-S is the motto! I suggest you always save your work
        before switching applications under MultiFinder
        (system&nbsp;6) and in System&nbsp;7. The files you save
        will be your own.</p>

        <p>A friend, a Mac consultant, tells me that, by unplugging
        a mouse with his Mac running he blew a fuse on his Mac's
        motherboard one time. It was easily replaced, but some
        repair people, taking advantage of a less experienced Mac
        user, might have swapped the entire board. That's big
        bucks! He also had two clients blow controller boards on
        hard drives by unplugging. It's a bad idea!</p>

        <p><b>Q</b> -- I get the Disk of the Month each month from
        my user group and I download interesting things from
        America Online. Often when I double-click on something from
        one of these disks or something I downloaded, I get a box
        telling me that the application is busy or missing. Why do
        they put out stuff that I can't use?</p>

        <p><b>A</b> -- Not all files work or open when you
        double-click on them. For example, Control Panels, INITs,
        printer fonts, etc., won't open. They are system documents
        that work through the system software. I suggest you read
        the documentation that accompanies before you try to use
        it.</p>

        <p>Also you must remember that many items are compressed to
        save disk space before they are distributed on disks of the
        month (from your user group) or on electronic information
        services. Often these files end with the suffix `.sit' or.
        `cpt.' or a similar string. You must decompress these files
        before they can be used, utilizing a program like StuffIt
        Expander, StuffIt, Compact Pro, Extractor, etc. These
        decompression/compression programs are available from user
        groups and electronic information services and come with
        excellent instructions on their use. Once you've
        successfully expanded a file you then have to attempt to
        use it.</p>

        <p>Let's examine the situation in which you have a document
        that can be opened, i.e., say a word processor file or a
        graphics file, not a control panel, INIT, or printer font,
        etc. When you double-click on such a document, the Mac
        checks it to see what program originally created it. Then
        it looks to see if you have that program. If you do have it
        -- no problem -- the document is opened in that program. If
        your Mac can't find the program it will give you the hated
        "application is busy or missing" dialog. If you get this
        dialog you have some alternatives. Many programs will open
        documents created by other programs, but you have to use a
        different technique. If you believe the document contains
        text, start-up your word processor and select "Open..."
        from the File menu. The Open File dialog box will appear
        allowing you to select a file. (If you do not know how to
        operate this dialog, complete instructions are in the
        manual that came with the computer.) If you see the
        document listed inside the standard Open File dialog box,
        select it, click "Open" and it will be opened. If the
        document is a graphic, try the same technique with your
        graphics program.</p>

        <p>It is a good idea to have one copy of Apple's TeachText
        on your hard drive since many instructions are created in
        that ubiquitous program. The bottom line, and one most Mac
        users hate to accept, is that you really should read
        instruction documents (the "Read me" files) that typically
        accompany any software you want to use.</p>

        <p><a name="anchor292433"></a><b>FirstClass(TM) Bulletin
        Boards</b>
        <br />
        Alex Morando, ASACMUG</p>

        <p>You may or may not be familiar with using your computer
        and modem to communicate with bulletin board services
        (BBS). Until recently, you had to be a computer jockey to
        navigate and understand the workings of a typical BBS; most
        of them use a command-line interface with menu shells
        similar to DOS. This steep learning curve for using a BBS
        explains the recent success of online services such as
        America Online, which offers a Mac-like interface to their
        Mac and PC customers.</p>

        <p>In 1992, SoftArc Inc. of Canada introduced
        FirstClass(TM) (FC), which turns any Mac into a fully
        functional BBS with a graphical user interface. FC allows
        as many people to logon up to the number of modems
        connected to the BBS computer. The software running the BBS
        is known as the <b>server</b> while the software you use to
        call the BBS is called the <b>client.</b> The FC client
        application (Mac or Windows) is free and is available from
        ASACMUG or from a local BBS. For first-time callers, FC
        provides a command-line interface to allow you to download
        the client. Each BBS has a <b>settings file</b> used by the
        client to display icons and sounds customized for that BBS.
        For optimum performance, it is best to call a FC board with
        a 2400 baud or higher modem.</p>

        <p>When a user calls up a FC BBS, he or she will not see a
        single command line, but rather a "Desktop" on that BBS.
        Message areas ("Conferences") are folders which are opened
        by simply double-clicking on the icon. Each Conference will
        have a list of messages and additional sub-conferences. To
        the user, the FC BBS looks just like another hard disk on
        the Mac, except that this disk is connected to your Mac via
        phone lines. Messages can be read in any order - by date,
        time, person, or subject. Thus, you can follow a single
        subject without diverting your attention to other
        discussions. Messages can be either sent to an individual
        person or to a conference (public). Files are treated as
        message enclosures in the same way you would enclose a
        floppy disk with a letter to a friend. A nice feature of FC
        is that it allows for multiple and simultaneous uploads and
        downloads; while you are downloading multiple files, you
        can also be uploading another file and reading messages,
        all at the same time.</p>

        <p>Other features supported by FC include text formatting
        (fonts, styles), color, sounds, aliases, mailboxes,
        resumes, talking to others in real-time, directory
        services, communicating with other FC BBS, and many other
        features that make using it a pleasure. Traditionally,
        setting up and maintaining a BBS is often a "labor of love"
        with long hours and large financial investments; FC is no
        different, but it makes running a BBS as much fun as using
        it.</p>

        <p>The ability of FC to connect to other FC boards has led
        to a growing network of Mac bulletin boards around the
        world. Known as OneNet, it is a network of approximately
        100 (and growing) FC boards sharing conferences, files, and
        information. For the price of a local call, you can access
        conferences with participants from around the country. More
        information can be found in the OneNet Primer, available
        from ASACMUG.</p>

        <p>The following is a short list of FC boards in Southern
        California. Give them a try.</p>

        <b>Are Our Floppies Safe for Your Data?</b>

        <p>The use of IBM pre-formated floppies in Macintoshes is
        believed to be responsible for many instances of corrupted
        data in ASE Engineering. The symptoms are that the disk
        seems to reformat properly and work satisfactorily but will
        suddenly become unusable. In most cases, the data has been
        recovered using Norton but in a least one instance, the
        data was lost.</p>

        <p>It is believed that the problem is that the Macintosh
        SuperDrive is not able to completely eliminate the heavy
        pre-formatting and that the traces that remain corrupts
        data written on top of them. The best advice is to avoid
        pre-formatted IBM floppies wherever possible. Where this is
        not possible, try reformatting the disk at least three or
        four times before using. Multiple reformatting is not a
        necessarily a cure but it cannot hurt. In ASE Engineering,
        either unformatted or Mac formatted floppies are being
        ordered in addition to the IBM formatted disks. Be sure to
        ask for the right preformatted disks for your machine.</p>

        with Someone
        <br /></b><i>(finding that on-ramp to the Internet)</i>
        <br />
        By Don Rittner, MUG News Service

        <p>Have you wanted to reach someone on the Internet, but
        can't seem to find a connection? More than a million and
        half hosts are connected to the Internet-- the global
        network of networks -- spanning more than 40 countries, and
        reaching some 40 million people.</p>

        <p>Millions of scientists, professionals, educators,
        students, business folks, government employees, and lay
        people use the Internet everyday to send email, download
        files, remotely logon to supercomputers and databases, join
        discussion lists, and work in online communities separated
        geographical by miles and miles and with no time
        constraints. It can be said if you can't find an answer to
        a question on the Internet, there is no answer!</p>

        <p>The Internet is a constantly moving freeway with
        virtually no stoplights and is quickly becoming the world's
        communications highway, but many of us can't seem to find
        an on-ramp.</p>

        <p><b>It's easier than you think.</b></p>

        <p>Over the past few years, parts of the Internet have been
        opening up to allow general computer user access. Today, if
        you have an account on any of the major commercial online
        services like America Online, CompuServe, and GEnie, you
        already have access to the Internet using their email
        capabilities.</p>

        <p>I'm going to show you how to become part of the Internet
        community this way.</p>

        <p>Most activities on the Internet come down to human
        communications-- personal to personal email-- and so
        America Online, CompuServe, and GEnie have developed
        special email gateways to the Internet (Prodigy has yet to
        follow suit). While you still cannot use the FTP (file
        transfer protocol - downloading files), and Telnet
        (remotely logging on to a computer as though you were at
        its location) facilities, you can reach the brain power of
        the Internet - millions of people.</p>

        <p>We will look at three commercial services, America
        Online, CompuServe, and GEnie, and a new email service
        called WorldLink.</p>

        <p><b>America Online (AOL)</b></p>

        <p>America Online is the new kid on the block of
        information services, opening its online doors in 1988. AOL
        is for users of Apple, Macintosh, and PC compatible
        computer users and sports a great graphical interface for
        all platforms. Users of all experience levels, from novice
        to pro, can navigate easily using windows, pull -down
        menus, and the "point and click" method using a mouse.</p>

        <p>AOL has hundreds of forums, downloadable files, special
        interest groups, news, and more to keep the average onliner
        happy. It currently has about 200,000 members.</p>

        <p><b>Sending Mail to the Internet</b></p>

        <p>On AOL, sending mail to a user on the Internet is as
        easy as sending mail to anyone on AOL. There really is no
        difference and there is no extra charge. The user selects a
        blank page from the mail menu and inserts the user's
        Internet ID into the destination (TO:) box.</p>

        <p>For example, if I wanted to send some mail to myself at
        my university address, SUNY at Albany, New York, I would
        address the mail like this:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><tt>drittner@uacsc1.albany.edu</tt></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>"drittner" is the user id at my Albany mailbox, the @
        (at) symbol separates the user id from the actual
        destination which in this case is the SUNY mainframe -- id
        is "uacsc1.albany.edu."</p>

        <p>That's all there is to sending email to the Internet on
        AOL. All of the magic of sending to the Internet is done
        invisibly by AOL.</p>

        <p>Now there are some restrictions. Outgoing mail cannot be
        larger than 32k (about 4500 words or 4 pages). On the Mac,
        Apple II, and PC-Link versions, you cannot receive mail
        larger than 27k, the rest will be truncated. On the PC
        version of America Online, and Promenade, incoming mail
        cannot be longer than 8K. Any text beyond 8K will be
        truncated. So, this means you cannot subscribe to Internet
        discussion lists or attach files.</p>

        <p>If for any reason your mail does not make it to the
        destination box, it's returned along with your actual
        text.</p>

        <p><b>Receiving mail on AOL</b></p>

        <p>To receive mail from the Internet or other commercial
        services, to your mailbox on AOL, the sender must know your
        AOL id and attach it to AOL's id which is "aol.com "--
        pretty easy. So if you wanted to send me mail you would
        address it to:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><tt>drittner@aol.com</tt></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>drittner is my AOL id, and aol.com is AOL's id.</p>

        <p><b>CompuServe (CIS)</b></p>

        <p>CompuServe Information Service (CIS), is the mother of
        all online services with 1,400 databases, some 170 forums,
        and more than 500,000 subscribers.</p>

        <p>It's easy to navigate through CIS's forums and services.
        CIS is menu driven but there are shortcuts to save time. To
        go to any of the services, CIS uses keywords combined with
        "Go." So to get to the mail area, for example, you type "Go
        Mail."</p>

        <p><b>Sending Messages To the Internet</b></p>

        <p>To send a message to an Internet address, you write or
        upload an ASCII text file of no more than 50,000 characters
        or 1000 lines using the CompuServe Mail editor. Each 2,500
        characters is about one double-spaced page.</p>

        <p>Unlike AOL, you must use a special addressing format to
        send to the Internet. When you are ready to address your
        mail to the recipient you need to add</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><tt>&gt;INTERNET: before the recipients ID.</tt></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>To send me mail from CIS to my university ID it would
        look like this:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><tt>&gt;INTERNET:drittner@uacsc1.albany.edu</tt></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>If your message is undeliverable, it usually will be
        returned to you along with the text of your message.
        Whether the message text is actually returned to you
        depends on the remote mail system, but you will always
        receive notification if your message cannot be
        delivered.</p>

        <p><b>Receiving Messages From Internet to CIS</b></p>

        <p>Only ASCII (text only) messages up to 50,000 characters
        can be sent through the gateway.</p>

        <p>When an Internet member wants to send a message to you
        they should know:</p>

        <p>-Your User ID number with the comma changed to a
        period.</p>

        <p>-The CompuServe domain address which is
        "compuserve.com"</p>

        <p>To send me mail on CIS, (my id is 70057,1325), it would
        look like this:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><tt>70057.1325@compuserve.com</tt></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Notice the comma has been changed to a period in my
        id.</p>

        <p>Receiving messages from Internet is charged the same as
        sending Mail for members on the CIS' Standard pricing plan,
        and the cost applies toward your monthly Mail usage
        allowance. There is no additional cost (other than connect
        time charges) to receive/read messages from Internet for
        members on the alternative pricing plan. So the most you
        will pay for reading Internet messages under the standard
        pricing plan ($7.95/month for basic services and an hourly
        rate for extended services) is .15 cents for the first
        7,500 characters, and .05 cents for each additional 2,500
        characters.</p>

        <p><b>GEnie</b></p>

        <p>GEnie (General Electric Network for Information
        Exchange), is a commercial online service owned and
        operated by General Electric since 1985. GEnie has over
        190,000 subscribers and offers mail, special interest
        groups, online shopping and travel, games, live
        conferences, computer user group "roundtables," clubs and
        software.</p>

        <p>GEnie is also menu driven and you can use keywords to
        save time. You simply type the keyword at the prompt, i.e.
        "Mail" to get to the mail prompt, or you can use the page
        number with the word move, i.e. "Move 200."</p>

        <p><b>Sending Mail to the Internet</b></p>

        <p>GEnie is similar to CIS in that you add an extension
        onto the user ID of the person you are sending mail to. So,
        if I were to send mail to my university account, it would
        look like this:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><tt>drittner@uacsc1.albany.edu@INET#</tt></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The @INET# tells GEnie that the mail is destined for the
        Internet.</p>

        <p><b>Receiving Mail from the Internet</b></p>

        <p>Likewise, if you want someone to send you mail from the
        Internet to your GEnie mailbox, they need to know GEnie's
        Internet ID which is "genie.geis.com." So to send me mail
        you would address it as:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><tt>MNS@genie.geis.com</tt></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>"MNS" is my user id on GEnie and "genie.geis.com" is
        GEnie's Internet ID.</p>

        <p>You can avoid using the extension of @INET# by going
        into a special Internet mail area by typing "Internet" at
        the prompt.</p>

        <p>Once you enter the Internet area, you can send Internet
        mail by choosing item 4 on the Internet main menu. This
        brings you into a special text editor.</p>

        <p>All you need to do in this text editor is write the
        user's Internet ID without any extensions, i.e.
        drittner@uacsc1.albany.edu. This special Internet mail area
        takes care of directing the mail to the Internet.</p>

        <p>Sending and receiving Internet Mail on GEnie has a
        surcharge. There is a $2.00 registration fee - this is a
        one time charge for all new users signing up for the
        service. However, if a user cancels and signs up again,
        another $2.00 is charged.</p>

        <p>Additionally, there is a charge of $.30 for each 5000
        bytes or portion thereof for incoming or outgoing
        messages.</p>

        <p>Canadian Rates are $3.00 registration fee and $.40 for
        each 5000 bytes or portion thereof for incoming or outgoing
        messages.</p>

        <p><b>Worldlink</b></p>

        <p>Not everyone is member of AOL, CIS, or GEnie, so what do
        you do now? There is a new service called WorldLink from
        InterCon Systems Corporation in Herndon, Virginia that
        fills the void.</p>

        <p>Worldlink is a special service for PC and Macintosh
        computer users that gives you a front end to the Internet
        using your own PC. You simply call one of thousands of
        access lines (in over five countries) to log on. InterCon
        offers two flavors - Worldlink-Email and
        WorldLink-Basic.</p>

        <p>The email version gives you off-line and batch reading
        and creation of email. This allows you to compose your text
        and the software then sends it, picks up any mail waiting,
        and then logs off, saving money. There is a flat rate of
        $19.00 per month (2400 bps) with no limited usage charges.
        For 9600 bps access, it's $29 per month.</p>

        <p>he Basic service gives you the email features but also
        gives you FTP --file transferring capabilities, and Usenet
        news -- thousands of conferences on a variety of subjects
        from Art to Zoology. As of this writing, only the PC
        version has Usenet access. January 93 is the target date
        for the Mac version.</p>

        <p>The Basic service is also done in real time, so you stay
        connected to the network to send and receive mail, transfer
        files and view the Usenet news. There is a monthly fee of
        $29 for 2400 bps access, $39 for 9600 bps. You are allowed
        50 megabytes per month and an additional charge of $1 per
        megabyte if you exceed the fifty. InterCon may have Telnet
        capabilities in the future.</p>

        <p>For those who do not have a local access point, InterCon
        will shortly have a 800 number for a small fee.</p>

        <p><b>Happy Trails</b></p>

        <p>So there you have it. Internet access to millions of
        people without really worrying about having a direct
        connection, and in the case of CIS and GEnie, for very
        little extra cost. Of course, if you still want to remote
        logon, subscribe to Internet mailing lists and bulletin
        boards, you need to get a "real" connection (more about
        that in future columns). And you still need to know the
        Internet id of the person you want to correspond with.
        There is no master Internet telephone book to look up names
        yet -- but give it time.</p>

        <p>SoftArc is a member of the Apple Partners Program, a
        privilege granted to relatively few commercial Apple
        software developers. This means that not only are we a
        "commercial developer of Applereg.-compatible products and
        services", but also a strategic commercial developer. Apple
        states:</p>

        <p><i>Apple limits membership in this program to developers
        who directly contribute to Apple's long-term product
        strategies and business objectives.</i></p>

        <p>SoftArc's membership in the Partner's Program was
        granted on the strength of its FirstClass product.</p>

        <p>Today SoftArc's FirstClass flagship communications
        product is sold around the world in more than 25 countries
        as well as in the U.S. and Canada. In total these systems
        encompass over 100,000 user mailboxes and 20,000
        conferences.</p>

        <p>FirstClass is used by businesses, educational
        institutions, government and private individuals. In
        addition there are a large number of public access online
        information services that use the FirstClass software.</p>
