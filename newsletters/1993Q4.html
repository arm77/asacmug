        <p><b>President's Column</b></p>

        <p>Happy holidays and welcome to the second edition of our
        electronic user's group newsletter. I'm happy to report
        that the magic of electronic mail has allowed the user's
        group to add well over 100 new readers at AlliedSignal
        locations from Tokyo to Europe. We've gotten behind sending
        out the new member materials but please be patient -- we'll
        get it working early next year.</p>

        <p>Our first electronic issue had a few growing pains. We
        intended to publish the newsletter in a format with a
        self-contained reader so that it could be read without
        having to use a separate application. Unfortunately, the
        file became corrupted and no one was able to open the file
        to read. A revised newsletter in MS Word format was sent as
        soon as the problem was discovered. If this should ever
        happen again, please wait a few days before trying to
        contact us since we'll probably already be working on the
        problem.</p>

        <p><i>MacWorld Expo</i></p>

        <p>MacWorld is the Macintosh industry's largest trade show
        and is expect to draw well over 60,000 attendees to San
        Francisco, January 5-8, 1994. The show is exciting with the
        latest in Mac technology, the broad spectrum of Macintosh
        products and even great show specials. There are also a
        hundred of conference sessions covering everything Mac
        including beginners sessions, Mac in education, software
        development, and how to market a Mac product. Apple and
        other companies often uses MacWorld as a forum for new
        announcements and releases.</p>

        <p>This year, ASACMUG will have at least eight members
        attending at their own expense. Most of the eight have
        attended before and will agree that its a worth while
        event. Two members will represent ASACMUG at the Apple
        Users Group Connection meeting which will feature Apple's
        new electronic information service similar to AppleLink,
        America On-line and CompuServe. Although the members attend
        on their own, they usually spend significant time
        researching possible solutions for AlliedSignal problems
        and issues. I personally urge anyone who can attend plan to
        attend. See the article on MacWorld for more information.
        (By the way, if you decide to attend - we'll be staying at
        the Travelodge at Fishermen's Wharf -- please contact Mike
        Quan if you want to attend the ASACMUG dinner.)</p>

        <p>See you at MacWorld!</p>

             Macs</b>

        <p>The Macintosh will be 10 years old next month. It has
        not only come a long way, it has also almost come to the
        end of a part of its life cycle and is about to become
        reborn. Production of a new series of Macintoshes is about
        to begin which will not use the Motorola 68000 family of
        processors (CPU). The new processor is the PowerPC which
        uses a reduced instruction set and was developed by IBM and
        Motorola. The chip is already in used by IBM in their own
        series of computers. The new processor is a serious threat
        to Intel's line of 80X86 processors and offers the
        prospects of higher performance, lower costs, and the
        ability to run Mac, Windows, and other operating systems.
        The next 12-18 months may drastically alter the personal
        computer industry.</p>

        <p>Although the PowerPC will be featured in next month's
        newsletter, here's a few "facts". The PowerPC Mac will
        initially be about three times faster than current Macs at
        about the same price. It can run most existing Macintosh
        software and even Microsoft's Window's based software in
        emulation mode at speeds comparable to a Centris 610 or a
        486/33mhz PC compatible. Applications that are ported to
        the new platform (which will include Word, Excel, Canvas)
        will have advantage of a 3X speed increase over the fastest
        Macs and PCs today. The PowerPC processor is comparable to
        the Intel Pentium at the same clock speed but the chip
        costs half as much, is half the size, and dissipates half
        the power. Reports by developer claim that a PowerPC Mac
        actually run graphics based applications 50%faster than an
        equal clock speed Pentium indicating that the speed is the
        same but the architecture is more efficient.</p>

        <p><a name="anchor430077"
           id="anchor430077"></a><b>MacWorld Expo 1994</b></p>

        <p>The Expo (mentioned in the previous page) is a chance
        for Mac enthusiasts to reaffirm the fact that the Macintosh
        is the premier personal computer in the world, meet with
        top Apple executives, deal with corporate sales managers
        from hundreds of companies like Claris, Microsoft, and
        Adobe, talk shop with programmers, demo and test software,
        and meet ordinary people who have made Macintosh a part of
        their lives. Last but not least, it is a fun show to
        attend.</p>

        <p>Between the first 128K and the upcoming PowerPC
        machines, the Mac has been the source of many innovations
        -- built-in displays, 3-1/2 inch floppy disks, 24-bit
        color, a graphical user interface, uniform look-and-feel
        between applications, built-in networking, plug-and-play,
        long filenames, desktop publishing, and many other features
        only now being implemented on other computer platforms.</p>

        <p>This upcoming MacWorld Expo is significant because it
        marks the 10th anniversary of the Macintosh. In that short
        time, the Mac has evolved from a small toaster-like machine
        (sans cooling fan!) to the imminent release of PowerPC
        Macs, which promise performance levels unheard of on the
        desktop, exceeding even the upcoming Pentium processor. The
        first decade, coupled with the first year of Newton,
        promise to make this MacWorld Expo an interesting one.</p>

             height="236"
             naturalsizeflag="3"
             align="right" />The Expo will be held in Moscone
             Center in San Francisco (see map). Show hours are from
             10am to 6pm on Jan 5-8. Registration is $40 for
             exhibits only and $150 for both exhibits and
             conferences. This is San Francisco's largest
             convention, so it may be hard to get accommodations
             unless you reserve a few months in advance. It is a
             show worth going to at least once, and this author
             will be attending his sixth Expo.</p>

        <p>There is at least one MacWorld Expo being held somewhere
        in the world every month, although the San Francisco
        (January) and Boston (August) shows are the largest in
        terms of attendance and floor space. If you cannot make it
        in 1994, maybe 1995 will give you a chance. If you are
        going, you may want to go to the information booth at the
        show and page Mike Quan or leave a message at the MUGWUMP
        (a meeting place for user groups); there will be an ASACMUG
        get-together during show hours and a dinner on one of the
        nights.</p>

        <p><i>See you at the show!</i></p>

             Folder</b>

        <p>Almost every Mac user knows what the System Folder is --
        it's the folder where all the important files are kept that
        the Mac needs to perform it's job, whether it's opening a
        new document, accessing a shared Mac, or playing a sound.
        On most Macs, it's simply called "System Folder", although
        it can be any name you want.</p>

        <p>Most users don't know or care what is in the System
        Folder. It can be messy or neat, but what makes it Mac-like
        is that it works a much better than having to mess around
        with AUTOEXEC.BAT or WIN.INI files. Click-and-drag is very
        simple.</p>

        <p>With a little bit of knowledge, you can poke around in
        the System Folder and fine tune your Mac -- speed it up a
        bit, reset some applications, or customize to your heart's
        content. We will assume that you have a version of System 7
        running. If you have System 6, an upgrade is recommended,
        even if you have to get more RAM; only those with older
        Macs (Plus, SE) should think carefully before
        upgrading.</p>

        <p><i>What's in the System Folder?</i></p>

        <p>A System Folder is created when you install or reinstall
        system software. The installation process places at least
        five major folders (six if you have System 7.1) and two
        files -- System and Finder.</p>

        <p><i>The System File</i></p>

        <p>The System file contains crucial information required by
        the Mac to operate, such as bug fixes, basic definitions
        used by all Mac programs (menu bars, windows, icons,
        sounds, etc), and information on how the software will
        operate the hardware. Since there are so many Mac models
        out there, a System file for a IIsi will be very different
        than one for a Centris 610. Thus, it is recommended to
        install only from installation disks; never copy a System
        file from one machine to another.</p>

        <p><i>The Finder</i></p>

        <p>The Finder file is the program that manages files and
        disk access. It is what Mac users use when they are not
        using a program like Word or FileMaker. The Finder has many
        abilities -- it can delete files, find files, classify
        files, and restart or shutdown the Mac. The Finder is so
        intuitive that nothing more needs to be said about it,
        although System 7's Balloon Help has a nice feature that
        shows all the keyboard shortcuts associated with the
        Finder.</p>

        <p>There may also be additonal files in the System Folder.
        You can have a Clipboard file, which contains the last item
        cut or copied; NotePad and Scrapbook files when you use the
        Notepad or Scrapbook desk accessories (DA).</p>

        <p><i>Folders in the System Folder</i></p>

        <p>The five/six major folders affect the Macs operation on
        different levels.</p>

        <p>The <u>Startup Items</u> folder is only used when the
        Mac is first started (or restarted); it opens the items in
        this folder in alphabetical order. It doesn't have to be an
        application but can be a document, a sound, or even a file
        server; usually, aliases are placed here since the actual
        items are better placed outside the System Folder.</p>

        <p>The <u>Apple Menu Items</u> folder contains the list of
        items displayed under the Apple Menu. Before System 7, only
        DAs could be placed here. With System 7, almost anything
        can be under the Apple menu for quick access. Like the
        Startup Items folder, it is better to place aliases in this
        folder rather than the actual files/folders. Think how huge
        the System Folder would become if every application were
        placed under the Apple Menu!!</p>

        <p>The <u>Control Panels</u> folder contains small programs
        that control various aspects of the Mac. You use control
        panels to set your desktop pattern, define a beep sound,
        setup your Mac for file sharing, and many other things.</p>

        <p>The <u>Extensions</u> folder has files that control your
        Mac at a lower level than Control Panels. These files
        usually do not have a user interface and are generally
        loaded at startup; they are known as device drivers for
        those familiar with PCs. It lets the Mac know how to talk
        to printers, scanners, hard disks, and other peripherals.
        This folder also allows you to extend the capabilities of
        your Mac --QuickTime and PlainTalk are two examples.</p>

        <p>The <u>Preferences</u> folder contains preferences for
        all the programs you use. Well written applications should
        not modify anything in the System Folder except for the
        preference file(s) for that specific application.</p>

        <p>For those with System 7.1, the <u>Fonts</u> folder
        contains various bitmapped and TrueType fonts, either as
        single documents or grouped in suitcases. If you add or
        delete a font, an application must quit first and restarted
        before seeing any changes in the Fonts folder.</p>

        <p><i>System Folder Tips</i></p>

        <p>There are a few ways to speed up your Mac and/or gain
        more memory. By carefully selecting what goes into the
        System Folder, you are allocating resources and CPU time to
        various functions. For example, you may get faster Excel
        recalcs by disabling that cute Control Panel that belches
        everytime you eject a disk, or by temporarily turning off
        File Sharing. The following are some hints to improve
        performance.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>If you are using a PostScript printer and only use
          the built-in fonts in that printer, drag all TrueType
          fonts out of the System folder (7.0, 7.0.1) or the Fonts
          folder (7.1). This will disable TrueType and speed up
          text displays.</li>

          <li>If you are using PostScript/Type 1 fonts and are not
          getting good printouts, place the fonts in the System
          Folder itself instead of the Extensions folder (or vice
          versa). Some older printer drivers are not aware of the
          Extensions folder, while some newer drivers only look at
          the Extensions folder. Good drivers will look both
          ways.</li>

          <li>The standard install puts a lot of printer drivers in
          the Extensions folder. By keeping only those printer
          extensions you use, you can speed up the Chooser when
          selecting printers or other network devices.</li>

          <li>If you have a CD-ROM drive and are not using it to
          play audio CD's, remove the Foreign File Access
          extension. You will have about 350K of RAM.</li>

          <li>If you have a PowerBook, installing AppleTalk Remote
          Access (ARA) will put a lot of modem device drivers in
          the Extensions Folder. Keep only those drivers which you
          use.</li>

          <li>Trash desk accessories you don't need anymore --
          Calculator (if you have a better one), Puzzle, and
          Notepad come to mind.</li>

          <li>Use programs like Apple's Extensions Manager (free)
          or Baseline's INIT Manager (commercial) to manage your
          extensions and control panels. These utilities (which are
          themselves extensions) help you create configuration
          'sets'. For example, you can have one set for normal work
          and another set when you are accessing the network
          frequently.</li>

          <li>Use one of many commercial programs to make the Apple
          Menu hierarchical. This greatly increases the usefulness
          of the Apple Menu. For example, by placing an alias of a
          hard disk or folder under the Apple Menu, you can drag
          down to that disk/folder and submenus will pop up. For
          example, I usually keep my application aliases in an Apps
          folder in the Apple Menu Items Folder. I use a leading
          space to put it at the top. Thus, my applications are
          only a short click-and-drag away.</li>

          <li>As you acquire and discard applciations, you may find
          that the number of preference files gets quite large and
          may take up a lot of disk space. It is a good idea to
          occassionally 'clean up' this folder by trashing any
          preference files for applications you no longer use.
          Also, if an application is behaving badly, one solution
          may be to delete its preference file, effectively
          'resetting' the application.</li>

          <li>Note that the Fonts folder can only contain a maximum
          of 128 files, but multiple files can be combined in
          suitcases and the operating system will sort them all out
          in the Font menu of most applications; thus, this folder
          can hold more than 128 fonts.</li>

          <li>If you don't have an extension manager described in
          7), create dummy folders called X (disabled), where X are
          the names of the five/six major subfolders. To disable a
          file, simply move it from folder X to folder X (disabled)
          before rebooting the computer.</li>

          <li>If you don't know exactly where a file goes, drop it
          on the System Folder icon (not the System Folder window
          itself). If it's an Extension, Control Panel, Sound, or
          Font, it will be put in the proper folder.</li>

          <li>There may be other folders within the System Folder
          or its five/six major subfolders. Usually, large
          applications put their own folder in the System Folder
          instead of using the Preferences folder. For example,
          Claris puts a "Claris" folder in the System Folder while
          Microsoft puts a "Microsoft" folder in the Extensions
          folder. This is acceptable since multiple applications
          may require access to common files such as help systems
          or dictionaries. As with preferences, these folder should
          be examined once in a while to see if there are any
          obsolete or outdated files or folders.</li>

          <li>Use the Monitors Control Panel to set the display to
          fewer colors. Going from 256 to 16 colors speeds up most
          programs.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><i>Getting a Handle on your Mac</i></p>

        <p>As you work on the Mac, you will get a rough feeling
        which of your Control Panels or Extensions are eating up
        your precious CPU cycles or valuable RAM. Using a
        'bare-bones' Mac (a Mac that has been rebooted with the
        Shift key held down) gives a good indication of the fastest
        speed possible. It gives a good estimate how much your
        extensions and control panels slow the Mac down. Since each
        Mac has a different setup according to your tastes, it is
        important to know how to free up resources if and when you
        have to.</p>

        <p><a name="anchor431382"
           id="anchor431382"></a><b>New Macs from Apple</b></p>

        <p>In recent years, Apple has been introducing products at
        a dizzying pace. Of all kinds of Macintosh computers ever
        produced by Apple, over half have come in the last 18
        months; this is noteworthy considering that this January
        will mark the 10th anniversary of the Mac's
        introduction.</p>

        <p>The last product announcement this year was held last
        October, when Apple introduced 14 new models. It also
        signified a reduction in the types of computers Apple will
        be selling in the future; the entire product line has been
        reduced to four: Performas for home and family use,
        PowerBooks/Duos for portable computers, LC Macs for the
        educational market, and Quadras for business and industry.
        Thus, computers with identical capabilities will be sold
        under different labels, which can confuse the prospective
        buyer: Should my son buy an LC 475 from college or is the
        Performa 476 from Circuit City a better deal?</p>

        <p>This article summarizes the October 1993 Macs, since
        these new products offer something for every budget. Prices
        are approximate and can vary from store to store. Most
        standard configurations come with at least 4 megs of RAM
        and an 80Meg hard drive, although 8 Megs of RAM and a 120
        meg hard disk is highly recommended as a minimum if you
        plan on using more of the advanced features like multimedia
        and networking. All the new Macs except for the Duos come
        with at least one expansion slot.</p>
        <hr />

        <p><i>Performa 410</i> - This is a standard low-end
        Macintosh. It comes with a 16MHz 68030 processor (the same
        one as found in the Mac IIcx, Mac IIvi, and Mac SE/30).
        However, it has a 16-bit data bus and is half the speed of
        other Macs with a full 32-bit data bus. Unless you are on a
        tight budget, the 410 is not recommended as better Macs can
        be bought for only 100-200 dollars more.</p>

        <p><i>Performa 460/Performa 466/Performa 467</i> - These
        are entry-level Macs with a 33Mhz 68030 processor with a
        full 32-bit data bus. It is most useful for tasks like word
        processing and light graphics, and is an ideal general use
        machine. One good feature is its ability to display up to
        32,000 colors on a 14" monitor. The only difference between
        the 460, 466, and 467 is the type of software bundled with
        each machine. Otherwise, they are identical and cost well
        under $1000 for a complete system.</p>

        <p><i>Performa 475/Performa 476</i> - These are Macs based
        on a 25MHz 68LC040 processor and is roughly 2 1/2 times
        faster than the Performa 460. Like the 460, it can display
        up to 32,000 colors on a 14" monitor. These machines are
        useful for doing number crunching (although a math
        coprocessor is absent), QuickTime, programming, and
        handling more than two applications open simultaneously.
        The only difference between the 475 and 476 is the
        availability of bundled software. If you have "TBD" as one
        of the things you want your computer to do, these are good
        machines to buy.</p>

        <p><i>Performa 550</i> - In terms of speed, this is
        equivalent to a Performa 460. The main difference is the
        different case design, which has a built-in 14" color
        monitor and can hold an internal CD-ROM drive.</p>

        <p><i>LC475</i> - Identical to the Performa 475.</p>

        <p><i>Quadra 605</i> - Identical to the Performa 475.</p>

        <p><i>Quadra 610</i> - This low-end Quadra comes in a
        low-slung case design that can accommodate an internal
        CD-ROM drive and one NuBus expansion card. It replaces the
        short-lived Centris 610. The only difference is that the
        processor has been upgraded from a 20MHz 68LC040 (no math
        coprocessor) to a full 25MHz 68040 with a built-in math
        coprocessor. This is an ideal machine for most business and
        engineering users, and offers good number crunching and
        multimedia capabilities. It also contains one NuBus slot
        for future expandability and is eligible for a PowerPC
        upgrade in 1994.</p>

        <p><i>Quadra 650</i> - This Quadra is the mid-range
        business computer, with a metal case, room for an internal
        CD-ROM drive, three NuBus expansion slots, one PDS
        expansion slot, and a power supply to match. It replaces
        the short-lived Centris 650. The only difference is that
        the processor speed has been upgraded from 25MHz to 33Mhz.
        It is 33% faster than the Quadra 610 and offers more room
        for expansion. Like the 610, it is also eligible for a
        PowerPC upgrade in 1994.</p>

        <p><i>Quadra 660AV</i> - These is identical to the Quadra
        610 in terms of performance, but it offers additional
        audiovisual capabilities, hence the moniker AV. It contains
        a second processor to handle voice recognition, video input
        and output (to a TV or VCR), and a communications adapter
        that can function as a telephone, answering machine, fax
        machine, or cellular phone (though not all at once). This
        machine is ideal for those who involved in video or
        multimedia production.</p>

        <p>The abovementioned AV capabilities will be available in
        future Macs based on the PowerPC processor; if you need the
        AV capabilities now, buy a 660AV or the faster 840AV.
        Otherwise, wait for the new Macs to be introduced next
        year.</p>

        <p><i>Duo 250</i> - This PowerBook Duo contains a 33MHz
        68030. Note that this is not a "all-in-one" PowerBook - it
        doesn't have a floppy disk drive nor the same number of
        output ports in the back of the computer; you would need
        either a Duo Dock to turn it into a full desktop system or
        a Mini Dock to enable it to have capabilities of larger and
        heavier PowerBooks. However, it comes with a 16 greyscale
        active matrix screen (those who have seen active matrix
        screens usually don't go back to passive displays).</p>

        <p><i>Duo 270c</i> - Like the Duo 250, the 270c has a 33MHz
        68030 with an additional math coprocessor. However, it
        comes with a 32,000 color active matrix screen; this is the
        first portable with that many colors. Previous Mac and PC
        portables were limited to either 16 grey or 256 color
        screens. However, anyone who is thinking of getting the
        270c should first ask himself whether he needs that much
        color. An engineer probably doesn't, but an outdoor
        artist/photographer might.</p>

        <p>Expect more product announcements from Apple in 1994,
        including the highly anticipated PowerPC-based Macs and the
        "BlackBird" PowerBook. Additional products include system
        software updates, the Houdini PC-compatible board, and more
        Newton machines.</p>

        <p>Given the constraints of this article, I hope to have
        given you an overview of the lastest from Apple. I have not
        included important items such as maximum RAM and have left
        out much of the details regarding expansion slots. For more
        information and details, please ask your local Mac
        guru.</p>

        <p>For those with access to the ASACMUG BBS, there is a
        folder called "MacHistory.sea" (by Harry Phillipo) which
        gives a comprehensive list of all Macs ever produced. It is
        located under the following folder hierarchy:</p>

        <p><tt>ASACMUG BBS:Software Library:Public
        Domain/Shareware:Data</tt></p>

        <p>It includes details such as CPU speed, motherboard data
        path width, whether a math coprocessor is available,
        expansion slots, maximum RAM, SCSI transfer rate, number of
        colors, power supply, and date of introduction. Please read
        the READ ME file in that folder for information and
        printing instructions.</p>
