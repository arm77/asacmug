        <p>A few couple of years ago, AlliedSignal decided to
        standardized on the PC thus making future purchases of
        Macintosh computers very difficult without extensive
        justification. During the last year, the Sales and
        Marketing folks have been asked/forced to give up their
        favorite computer platform and convert to the Wintel
        (Windows-Intel) "standard". In addition, even the minimal
        support required for Macs compared to PCs has been
        difficult to acquire. With these factors, added to the
        overall doom often reported in the media with respect to
        Apple, it's understandable that many Macintosh followers
        fear the worst for the platform. Although Apple may be
        having problems, it's also having its fair share of
        successes which are often overlooked. For an excellent
        discussion of this area, read the article by Carry Lu, "The
        Holy Wars", inside this newsletter.</p>

        <p>Apple will have revenues of over $13 billion this year
        with the highest sales in terms of both revenues and units
        shipped in its history. The company has little or no debt
        and cash reserves of almost a billion dollars. It was the
        number one seller of personal computers in the U.S. during
        the last quarter beating out Packard Bell, Compaq, and IBM.
        It was recently rated #1 in consumer satisfaction by J.D.
        Powers and Assoc. and even #1 in reliability by
        PC&nbsp;Magazine. It is by far the leading computer in
        education with 65% of all computers in K-12 in the U.S.
        Even with the hype of Windows 95, it is still the standard
        for ease of use with the best reports of Windows 95 stating
        that Windows 95 is almost as good as or is closing the gap
        with the Mac. One of the biggest problems for Apple during
        the year was that it couldn't manufacture enough products
        and thus had as much as a one billion dollar back order for
        products. Nevertheless, Macintoshes which once seemed
        overpriced before factoring the extra not included on PCs
        (e.g.. networking, SCSI, Trinitron monitors, etc.) now are
        priced at or below comparable PCs, particularly the
        Performa line which includes over $1000 in software and CD
        ROM products.</p>

        <p>In my opinion, the most significant accomplishment was
        an almost seamless transition from the 680x0 microprocessor
        to the RISC based PowerPC processor. This accomplishment
        puts the MacOS on a solid hardware platform with
        performance potential to leave the competition in the dust
        with respect to both price and performance. Most observers
        agree that Apple made a mistake not licensing the MacOS
        many years ago but the situation has changed with several
        clone vendors turning out computers that not only compete
        but often exceed Apple's own offerings.</p>

        <p>This situation will improve further when computers based
        upon the Common Hardware Reference Platform (CHRP) begin
        shipping in mid 1996 manufactured by many hardware
        companies including Apple, IBM, Motorola, Canon, Power
        Computing, Radius, Daystar, and possibly even Gateway and
        other current PC vendors. The CHRP machines will be able to
        run any of four operating systems, MacOS, OS/2, UNIX, and
        even Windows NT.</p>

        <p>The Wintel camp also has a few challenges that are
        beginning to become visible. As much as Microsoft wishes
        for us to believe, Windows 95 is not a true 32 bit
        operating system, but rather a mixture of 16 and 32 bit
        code. The 16 bit code like an anchor that must be carried
        to maintain backward compatibility. A problem that has
        resulted is that the next generation Pentium Pro processor
        (P6) is optimized for 32 bit code and actually runs slower
        than a plain Pentium (P5) when running Windows 95. This is
        a problem which must be solved if the platform is continue
        its dominance.</p>

        <p>I'm predicting that Windows 95 will soon be replaced by
        a version of Windows NT with the Windows 95 interface. This
        will allow it to take advantage of the new RISC based
        processors (even those by Intel). This will mean that much
        of the older DOS based codes will either be broken or have
        to be handled via an emulator. The question will be whether
        this can be accomplished with minimal heartburn for the
        users. Apple has already successfully made the transition
        and will have an edge if Microsoft cannot pull this off
        flawlessly.</p>

        <p><a name="anchor602778"></a><b>MacWorld San Francisco
        '96</b></p>

        <p>ASACMUG will be represented at MacWorld, by about a half
        dozen members. The event will be held January 9-12
        (Tues-Fri.) at the Moscone Convention Center in San
        Francisco. With over 70,000 participants and hundreds of
        vendors, this is a very exciting event for Mac users and
        everyone is encouraged to attend if possible. For more
        information, contact any club officer. One idea to minimize
        both time and costs would be to make it a one day trip (you
        will not be able to see the whole show). Round trip air
        fare is about $100 but the best days would be on Wednesday
        or Thursday. See you there!</p>

        <p>Future of ASACMUG</p>

        <p>I've often been asked what is the future for ASACMUG now
        that Macs are an endangered species. The intended direction
        is to shift the club's emphasis from work to home use for
        those of us who use the Mac at home. The last significant
        group of Macs appears to be in Engineering who will
        probably take a couple years or more to completely displace
        them with PCs. We will try to continue to be a resource for
        those who still have Macs at AlliedSignal through our
        bulletin board personal advice, and even a newsletter. When
        ASACMUG first started, there were hardly any Macs in
        Torrance, but during the early years we saw significant
        growth in the Mac population. The intend is that the users
        group will continue in a low key mode doing what we can for
        Mac users. We would appreciate your comments.</p>

        <p><a name="anchor603050"></a><b>Word 6.0 for Macintosh
        FastTip: Setup/Performance Optimization
        <br />
        Microsoft Corporation</b></p>

        <p>The following are excerpts from the Microsoft
        KnowledgeBase (MW1052.DOC) Only sections for Macs with at
        least 6 Megs of RAM are included.</p>

        <p><b>Allocate Memory to Word</b></p>

        <p>When Word is installed, the installer program allocates
        a certain amount of memory to the Word application, based
        on the amount of memory on the Macintosh.</p>

        <p>2000K-2500K is sufficient for simple tasks and smaller
        documents. However, if you are working on larger documents
        (50 pages or more) or documents with many graphics, or if
        you are performing more memory- intensive tasks (such as
        grammar checking), allocate more memory to Word if it is
        available.</p>

        <p>For example, if you have 5 MB of memory, Word is
        allocated 2.5 MB when it is installed. If the system uses
        1.5 MB for itself, that leaves 3.5 MB available when no
        applications are running. You can safely allocate another
        .5 MB of memory to Word, bringing the total to 3 MB.</p>

        <p>To allocate more memory to Word, select the Microsoft
        Word icon in the Finder. From the File menu, choose Get
        Info. Increase the Preferred Size, based on how much
        available memory your Macintosh has. Allocating more memory
        to Word helps, but generally, unless your documents contain
        large numbers of graphics (in which case allocating up to 6
        MB of memory may improve performance), allocating more than
        3- 4 MB of memory to Word does not necessarily increase the
        speed of Word.</p>

        <p><b>Disk Cache</b></p>

        <p>You can increase the disk cache setting in your
        Macintosh if you have enough available memory. A larger
        disk cache can improve the performance of your Macintosh by
        setting up a portion of memory to store frequently used
        information that is usually accessed from a hard disk. The
        disk cache speeds up Macintosh operations such as opening
        and quitting Word, loading portions of Word (for example,
        the grammar checker), and switching between active
        programs. The disk cache option is located in the Macintosh
        Memory control panel.</p>

        <p><b>ADVANCED SETTINGS</b></p>

        <p>You can increase the BitMapMemory or CacheSize settings
        in Word's Advanced Settings if you have at least 8 MB of
        RAM. To modify these settings, use the procedures in the
        "Modify Word's Advanced Settings" section of this
        Application Note. That section also contains a description
        of the BitMapMemory and CacheSize settings.</p>

        <p><b>BitMapMemory</b></p>

        <p>If your documents frequently contain many bitmapped
        graphics (such as scanned images and screen captures), you
        can increase the redrawing and scrolling speed of bitmaps
        by increasing the amount of memory that Word reserves for
        these operations. On a computer with at least 8 MB of RAM,
        you can increase the BitMapMemory setting as high as 2048K
        (2 MB). The following sample entry from Advanced Settings
        sets the BitMapMemory value at 2048K:</p>

        <p><tt>[Microsoft Word] bitmapmemory=2048</tt></p>

        <p><b>CacheSize</b></p>

        <p>If you primarily work with large documents, you can
        increase the CacheSize setting to enlarge Word's internal
        Document Text cache. With a larger cache, Word does not
        need to access the hard disk as frequently, which speeds up
        performance. Start by changing the CacheSize setting to
        256K and then, if necessary, increase it to 1024K (1 MB).
        The following sample entries from Advanced Settings set
        these values respectively:</p>

        <p><tt>[Microsoft Word] cachesize=256</tt></p>

        <p><tt>[Microsoft Word] cachesize=1024</tt></p>

        <p>NOTE: You may not need both the BitMapMemory and
        CacheSize settings, depending on the type of documents you
        usually create. If you change one of these settings and do
        not notice any improvement in Word's performance, delete
        the setting so that Word, System 7.x, and other
        applications can use the memory for other operations. You
        may find that Word's default settings already provide
        optimal performance.</p>

        <p><b>General Speed Tips - Use the Right Display Mode for
        Faster Screen Display</b></p>

        <p>Monitor settings significantly affect operations on the
        Macintosh that entail redrawing the screen (for example,
        screen updates that occur when you scroll or update
        graphics). If you are writing reports and working with
        spreadsheets, you may need only 16 to 256 colors. (You can
        easily switch back to using more colors if no change in
        performance occurs or if your work requires additional
        video capabilities.)</p>

        <p>You can set the number of colors or shades of gray your
        monitor can use by opening the Monitors control panel in
        Control Panels.</p>

        <p><b>Optimize Hard Disk Access</b></p>

        <p>By optimizing your hard disk periodically, you can
        improve disk access time. The access speed of a hard disk
        affects overall Macintosh performance, more so in
        conditions of significant disk activity (such as reading or
        writing a file or reading an application or segments of an
        application). Because Word is a large application, a
        significant amount of hard disk access occurs when reading
        parts of the application into memory.</p>

        <p>[Programs such as Norton Utilities and MacTools can
        optimize drives.]</p>

        <p><b>Virtual Memory</b></p>

        <p>The System 7.x Virtual Memory feature swaps out portions
        of files and programs from memory to the hard disk. With
        the Virtual Memory feature turned on, a 4-MB Macintosh can
        perform tasks that require more than 4 MB of memory.
        However, because hard disk access time is much slower than
        memory access time, virtual memory is much slower than
        random- access memory. Whenever possible, you should not
        use virtual memory.</p>

        <p><b>How to Print Faster</b></p>

        <p>Many factors affect printing speed. Below is a short
        checklist of steps you can take that may help increase
        printing speed:</p>

        <p>Use printer-resident fonts instead of their TrueType(R)
        counterparts. For example, when you print to a
        PostScript(R) printer, if you normally use New York, use
        Times instead. These are very similar fonts (although Times
        is a bit smaller), but a font description for Times already
        exists in the printer. Therefore, the font definition is
        not added to the print job sent to the printer. The New
        York font description, however, does not exist in the
        printer, so it must be sent with the print job. Font
        descriptions can dramatically increase the size of a print
        job, which causes slower printing.</p>

        <p>If you print over a network, consult your network
        documentation to make sure your print server is working
        optimally.</p>

        <p>If you don't need to continue working while Word is
        printing, turn off the Background Printing option. This
        option allocates processor time to Word during a print job
        so that you can continue working; however, this means less
        processor time is available for printing. To turn off
        Background Printing, choose Chooser from the Apple menu,
        click once on your LaserWriter(R) printer on the left side.
        Under Background Printing in the bottom-right corner, click
        Off.</p>

        <hr width="52%" />

        <p>The battle between proponents of Macintosh and IBM PC
        computers has for many years resembled a religious war, and
        as in all religious wars, much of the rhetoric has been
        driven more by ignorance than knowledge.</p>

        <p>Very few people are truly skilled with both Macs and PC.
        Since PCs outsell Macs by a wide margin--seven to one or
        more--most people with computer experience actually know
        only about DOS and Microsoft Windows on an IBM PC or
        clone.</p>

        <p>Not surprisingly then, if you ask which computer should
        you buy, the most common answer -- from computer sales
        people, data processing managers, and newspaper columnists
        -- is a PC. But before you take that advice, ask if your
        adviser actually uses both Macs and PCs.</p>

        <p>If he or she knows only one system well, consider the
        advice suspect. Steer clear of PC bigots and Mac bigots who
        use jargon: "Only PCs support true pre-emptive multitasking
        and multiple processors." "Only Macs have dual-channel SCSI
        for fast disk arrays." These techie issues are irrelevant
        for most users; in any event both systems will offer all
        these features in the coming months.</p>

        <p>Which computer do I recommend? I think you should get
        the same kind of computer that your most technically astute
        friend uses -- a friend you can call at midnight on Sunday
        when you really get stuck. If you buy a Mac, you won't need
        an expert, since you won't get stuck nearly as often. And
        if you don't have a technical friend, you will be much
        better off with a Mac -- with some exceptions that I will
        discuss later.</p>

        <p>Is the Mac really that much easier to use? Consider
        this: One quarter of all the questions that Patrick
        Marshall has answered in his Q&amp;A column in The Seattle
        Times deals with PC problems that never occur on a
        Macintosh.</p>

        <p>Macintosh users never have to deal with memory
        management, interrupts, DMA channels, or a SYSTEM.INI file.
        Inside a Mac, there are no jumpers to set, either on the
        main board or on the vast majority of accessories.</p>

        <p>PC users have to learn these details or else they can't
        get software to run. The computer industry estimates that
        PC users have trouble running 25-35 percent of multimedia
        CD-ROMs. I'm accustomed to trouble.</p>

        <p>This morning, I installed a CD-ROM for my five-year-old
        on my Pentium computer and got a message: "Increase
        DMABuffer Size." I doubt if most PC users would know how to
        respond; what's more, no message explained two additional
        problems beyond the DMABuffer size.</p>

        <p>Through long experience, I have learned most of the
        hundreds of technical tricks necessary to get CD-ROMs
        running on a PC, although a few discs still have me
        stumped.</p>

        <p>Surveys show that PC users rarely buy CD-ROMs. A CD-ROM
        on a PC is too often like a book with pages glued together
        or illustrations torn out.</p>

        <p>CD-ROM installation problems are almost unheard of on a
        Mac, aside from a simple free update for recent system
        software (Apple's Multimedia Tuner). Two other problems are
        easy to understand -- CD-ROMs that need color won't run on
        a black-and-white Mac and a few CD-ROMs need more memory
        than the simplest Macs have.</p>

        <p>I've just answered the bulk of all Mac CD-ROM
        installation questions. In the past five years, I have not
        seen a single incompatible or even difficult-to-install
        CD-ROM on a Mac.</p>

        <p>Because no one has to learn any tricks, Mac users buy
        discs without trepidation. As a result, CD-ROM publishers
        find that Mac users buy CD-ROMs out of proportion to the
        Mac's market share.</p>

        <p>David Billstorm, president of Media Mosaic and publisher
        of Mountain Biking and other outdoor recreation CD-ROMs,
        tells me that 40 percent of sales are for Macs. Yet PC
        buyers call for technical support far more often than Mac
        buyers.</p>

        <p>Although both Mac and PC versions have the same price,
        Media Mosaic makes more money from the Mac versions because
        the cost of answering a single call can wipe out any profit
        from the sale.</p>

        <p>On Christmas day, none of my Mac friends called with
        problems; several PC friends called (and each one started
        by apologizing, "The support lines aren't open today. .
        .")</p>

        <p>The Mac is not completely free of software conflicts,
        especially for enthusiasts who tend to like complexity. But
        the conflicts are usually resolved by simply moving clearly
        labeled icons from one folder to another; if you make a
        mistake, you just move the icon back.</p>

        <p>On a PC, you must use far more difficult techniques --
        editing cryptic files (WIN.INI, AUTOEXEC, etc.), setting
        environment variables, adjusting memory locations, changing
        command-line switches in drivers. If you make a mistake,
        the computer may refuse to start.</p>

        <p>In the past year, the hottest new category of Windows
        software has been "uninstall" utilities, programs that can
        remove Windows software. Windows and Windows software can
        put dozens or even hundreds of files on a hard disk; a
        person can't keep track of the files without help from
        another computer program. The Mac neither has nor needs an
        equivalent utility; removing a program is usually simple
        and besides, every file is identified by its type and the
        program that created it.</p>

        <p>Quite aside from utilities, more software is available
        for the PC than for the Mac. You may have a specialized
        need that can be met only by a PC, particularly for
        business applications. In a few areas, particularly
        graphics, the Mac leads.</p>

        <p>For the vast majority of users, and certainly for anyone
        buying a family computer, there is no significant
        difference in the applications -- word processors and so on
        -- available for either system.</p>

        <p>Microsoft's applications and many other major programs
        come in both PC and Mac versions. The PC version may come
        out first, presumably because the publisher wants to reach
        the larger group of customers first.</p>

        <p>The real reasons may not be obvious. Aldus (now Adobe)
        PageMaker, a program that was originally developed for the
        Mac, came out in a version 5.0 first for Windows. The
        project manager explained to me that the programmers
        disliked Windows intensely. Aldus management insisted on
        the Windows version first, because if the programmers were
        allowed to finish the Mac version first, they might never
        finish the Windows version.</p>

        <p>Although the Mac has obvious appeal to the computer
        novice, the people who really understand computers also
        tend to prefer Macs. At the recent Electronic Entertainment
        Expo in Los Angeles, most of the new, unfinished multimedia
        computer software -- even software destined for PCs -- was
        demonstrated on Macs rather than PCs.</p>

        <p>Famed supercomputer designer Seymour Cray uses a Mac.
        Two division heads for major PC clone companies called me
        independently last year; they were leaving their companies
        and wanted to know which Macs to buy for their new
        startups. I know of three companies in the Portland area
        started in the past year by former Intel managers. Two of
        the three companies chose Macs as their principal
        computers. (Intel makes most of the CPU chips, such as the
        Pentium, that drive Windows computers.)</p>

        <p>Corporate data processing (DP) managers generally prefer
        PCs; most have little experience with Macs. PCs do ensure
        full employment for the DP staff.</p>

        <p>At Intel, where many employees are true computer
        experts, the DP department figures on one support person
        for every 30 Windows computers. The DP department was
        astonished to learn that one Intel division had 120 Macs
        and got along fine with a single support person.</p>

        <p>Mac users rarely have problems, and when they do, the
        answers usually come from other users rather than from the
        DP department. The hidden cost of support -- and perhaps
        frustration -- at least partially offsets the Mac's higher
        prices.</p>

        <p>The price gap has narrowed, but it will never close
        completely. Macs come with more standard features -- all
        Macs, including laptops, have sound and networking built
        in. Apple has usually -- but not always -- used higher
        quality components than the average PC clone.</p>

        <p>PC accessories are generally cheaper, but then I've seen
        a lot of bad keyboards and fuzzy monitors on PC clones. A
        good monitor costs the same for either system. Ultimately,
        Apple spends more money; it makes major investments in
        research and development. For the typical PC clone company,
        R&amp;D consists of reading spec sheets from Taiwan.</p>

        <p>Macs have a longer useful lifetime. I use a
        five-year-old Mac to play today's multimedia CD-ROMs
        without difficulty. In the past five years on my PC, I've
        had to change the CPU twice, the video card twice, the
        motherboard twice, and the sound board once, just to play
        ordinary discs. (I also switched to double-speed CD-ROM
        drives on both systems.)</p>

        <p>Apple has made many strategic errors. The first
        Macintosh clones are only now beginning to appear. Ten
        years ago, I called for Apple to license the Mac operating
        system at a MacWorld Expo keynote panel. Many in the
        audience hissed at my remarks. Yet by refusing to license
        the Mac system early, Apple made the enormous success of
        Microsoft Windows possible.</p>

        <p>Within the computer industry, the description "more like
        a Macintosh" is always high praise. The description "more
        like Windows" is rarely used as praise, except perhaps in
        contrast to "more like DOS."</p>

        <p>Microsoft tells everyone that its forthcoming Windows 95
        is more like a Macintosh. The key features of Windows 95 --
        long file names, plug-and-play hardware installation,
        direct file display -- have been on the Mac for eleven
        years. Yet despite much clever engineering by Microsoft,
        Windows 95 cannot overcome the chaos inherent to the PC
        world, both for hardware and for the need now to run three
        wildly different operating systems and application software
        (for DOS, Windows 3.1, and Windows 95). Mac users have
        never had to cope with such jarring changes.</p>

        <p>Microsoft's genius lies in getting things to work --
        more or less -- despite the PC chaos. Apple's genius lies
        in getting so many things right in its fundamental
        Macintosh design and avoiding chaos.</p>

        Low-cost, laser-quality printing for under
        $250</b><img src="1995Q4_assets/image2.gif"
             width="33"

             naturalsizeflag="3" /><b><br />
        Alex Morando, AES Engineering</b></p>

        <p>Back in 1989, while Macs were leading the way to
        acceptance of laser printers, Apple introduced the
        SytleWriter inkjet printer. These printers, which uses
        electrical charges to spray ink bubbles on paper, proved
        very popular to those who couldn't afford a laser printer,
        which cost about $2000 a few years ago. Even today, getting
        a good PostScript laser printer will set you back about
        $1000; you could buy non-PostScript laser printers for less
        than $500, but would you want to?</p>

        <p>Last April, the SytleWriter 1200 was introduced. It uses
        a new Canon printing mechanism that prints at 720-by-360
        dots per inch resolution, prints greyscale images using
        Apple's GreyShare technology, uses easily available ink
        cartridges used by the older StyleWriters and Canon inkjets
        for PCs, and comes at a street price of under $250, with
        some stores selling them for under $229. I'd finally
        decided to retire my six-year old ImageWriter and brought
        one home.</p>

        <p><b>Setup and Features</b></p>

        <p>The printer is easy to setup - out of the box, install
        the ink cartridge, connect the power cord, connect to the
        Mac via a serial cable, install the software, and print a
        test file. The printer controls are simple - there is only
        a single on/off switch at the top center of the printer.
        Two lights indicate when the printer is on and if there is
        a printing error. The printer is Energy Star compliant - it
        automatically turns itself on when printing and turns
        itself off after five minutes of inactivity.</p>

        <p>The paper feeder holds up to 50 sheets of paper and
        doesn't make the paper do turns like most laser printers.
        Printing envelopes requires that two switches be set - one
        at the feeder and one above the inkjet cartridge. This is
        the only feature that cannot be controlled from the
        computer. A slide-out paper tray lets me place it on a
        small bookcase and takes up very little space.</p>

        <p><img src="1995Q4_assets/image5.gif"
             width="216"
             height="165"
             align="left"
             naturalsizeflag="3" />One of the best features of the
             SW1200 is the printing software which comes on five HD
             disks. Although it requires System 7.1 as a minimum,
             it adds many nice features that make working with it a
             pleasure:</p>

        <p><b>Native driver</b> - Optimized for Power Macintosh.
        Even if you don't have a PowerMac, the driver is compatible
        with all Macs, albeit slower. Since the SW1200 is not a
        PostScript printer, all processing must be done on the Mac.
        When printing simple text and graphics on a PowerMac, the
        software so fast that it is often waiting for the printer
        to finish the current page before sending the next page.
        You can easily get the full 3 pages-per-minute output
        advertised on the box. However, when printing in 720-by-360
        mode (highest quality), you will only get 1.5 ppm.</p>

        <p><b>Desktop Printers</b> - This feature was previously
        available only under QuickDraw GX, which was discussed in
        the last newsletter. When active, an icon representing your
        printer shows up on the desktop. To print, you simply drag
        a document over the printer; it will launch the
        application, issue a print command, and quit the
        application automatically. For example, you can take the
        file vent.html and drag it over the SytleWriter icon to
        print.</p>

        <p><img src="1995Q4_assets/image6.gif"
             width="174"
             height="110"
             align="left"
             naturalsizeflag="3" />Double clicking on the printer
             icon produces a status window where the user can
             temporarily suspend printing, rearrange and delete
             print jobs, and monitor progress.</p>

        <p><b>Background printing and sharing</b> - The first
        feature allows you to batch print your document and
        continue to do other things without waiting for the
        computer to finish printing; this feature was previously
        available to networked PostScript printers only. Although
        the SW1200 cannot be connected to a network, the second
        feature allows the computer to "share" the printer to the
        network; this is analogous to sharing files and folders
        across the network. The SW1200 can effectively be seen and
        used by others on the network on two conditions - the host
        Mac is on and the owner activates Printer Sharing when
        setting up the printer. When shared, the owner's Mac will
        sometimes slow down as it accepts and processes print jobs
        from other people.</p>

        <p><img src="1995Q4_assets/image7.gif"
             width="244"
             height="126"
             align="right"
             naturalsizeflag="3" /><b>Printing options</b> - the
             new Page Setup dialog box allows 4-up printing to save
             trees and a Watermark option to print a greyscale
             image behind every page. For example, you may wish to
             put a large "DRAFT" watermark behind all preliminary
             documents you distribute. There are also options for
             the type of paper (plain, coated, glossy) and whether
             to use GreyShare for graphics.</p>

        <p><b>TrueType fonts</b> - 65 of them, including decorative
        fonts like <img src="1995Q4_assets/image9.gif"
             width="62"
             height="10"
             align="bottom"
             naturalsizeflag="3" />and <img src=

             width="96"
             height="14"
             align="bottom"
             naturalsizeflag="3" />, in addition to standard
             business and casual styles.</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="1995Q4_assets/image8.gif"

             align="bottom"
             naturalsizeflag="0" /></p>

        <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

        <p>The SW1200 is for those whose graphics output is not too
        complicated. It is ideal for home and office use to create
        short memos, listings, charts, graphics thumbnails, and
        newsletters. In 4-up mode, I've been using it to print
        documentation and C source code.</p>

        <p>The SW1200 is <b>not</b> a PostScript printer. Don't
        expect it to successfully print out 2 meg Photoshop files
        or large PostScript illustrations; if you did, you'd
        already have that $2000 laser printer nearby.</p>

        <p>For those willing to wait a little longer or pay a
        little more, Apple has the Color StyleWriter 2400
        ($450).</p>

        A Review By Roger Wright</b></p>

        <p><b>What is Tex-Edit Plus?</b></p>

        <p>Tex-Edit Plus is a multi-window, styled text editor that
        fills the gap between Apple's very simple Teach Text and
        it's immediate successor, SimpleText. Tex-Edit Plus is a
        Shareware product of Tom Bender of San Angelo, Texas.
        (Note, the state of Texas, and the name of the
        application.)</p>

        <p>The Shareware cost is a measly $5.00; for this amount,
        this is the best buy in Macintosh software; everyone should
        have a copy of Tex-Edit Plus on their Macintosh. It can be
        obtained from many bulletin boards (I got my copy from
        America Online), and we will have it on the AES Macintosh
        BBS. Note that there were several predecessor versions of
        this application under the name of "Tex-Edit" -- the last
        version I know of was 2.7. The author decided to start a
        new application when he added a number of features and
        modifications; two of which were the expansion to handle
        files larger than 32k, and the requirement to run under
        System 7, abandoning System 6.</p>

        <p><b>My Main Reason for Using Tex-Edit Plus: Reading and
        Printing TeachText Documents</b></p>

        <p>Before describing some of the many features of Tex-Edit,
        I'll give you my main use of the application. Almost all
        Macintosh software come with "Read Me" or instructional
        files that a set up for TeachText, or its successor
        SimpleText. That is, by double-clicking on the file icon,
        TeachText or Simple Text open up. Either of these is fine
        for reading the file on the screen, but if you want a
        printed copy of the document, you must put up with the
        built-in margins and pagination of the TeachText (or Simple
        Text). This usually means that on a laser printer you will
        have 0.5-inch margins, which I dislike very much for use in
        3-ring binders.</p>

        <p>Also, if you'd like to edit the document, to put in
        additional material or to add emphasis, the Apple-supplied
        editors are very poor, if not impossible.</p>

        <p>At one time I tried opening the Read-Me texts in
        Microsoft Word 5.1, but was very disappointed in that the
        pictures in the TeachText document were lost. I one case
        using a "screen-clip" F-Key, I was able to place all of the
        pictures into the Word document through copies and pastes.
        But, this is extremely time-consuming and very tedious.
        Later, I purchased MacWrite Pro. It very nicely opens the
        TeachText documents (including pictures) and allows such
        documents to be edited. If one is familiar with MacWrite
        Pro, this route to customizing the look of the document and
        printing with favorable margins would not be too bad.
        Another approach involves first the opening of the document
        in MacWrite Pro, and then saving it out as a Word document.
        This preserves the pictures, and if you're more familiar
        with Word than MacWrite Pro (as I am), the editing and
        printout can be done there.</p>

        <p>But the simplest and quickest way to print out such
        documents with your own specified margins, is to use
        Tex-Edit Plus. The margins are easily setup to your
        desires, and if you want specific pagination, your can
        insert page breaks anywhere. The printout can also be page
        numbered. I keep an alias of Tex-Edit Plus on my desktop
        specifically for opening Read-Me documents.</p>

        <p>Tex-Edit Plus allows special additions and
        modifications. Individual selected text can be styled as to
        size, font and character. Color can be added, etc. One word
        of caution: the justification (left, center, right or full)
        applies to the overall document, not just specific
        sections.</p>

        <p><b>Tex-Edit Plus For E-Mail</b></p>

        <p>From the author's summary of Tex-Edit Plus capabilities,
        the following would be useful for e-mail (Tex-Edit Plus
        uses the same style implementation as AOL, eWorld,
        SimpleText, Joliwrite, and Stylus):</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reformat downloaded e-mail or text, correcting
          word-wrap problems and removing extraneous, non-Mac
          characters.</li>

          <li>Prepare text for upload to a BBS, so that people with
          MS-DOS systems can view the document as it was intended
          to be viewed.</li>

          <li>Instantly quote a brief passage from received e-mail,
          allowing the sender to remember their original
          message.</li>

          <li>Add color to your America Online or eWorld
          e-mail.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Miscellaneous Tex-Edit Plus Capabilities</b></p>

        <p>The full capabilities of Tex-Edit Plus are too numerous
        to mention in this short review. I have picked out a few
        for examples.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Drag and Drop is supported through Apple's Drag
          Manager. This applies within the working document, across
          several windows of Tex-Edit Plus, or even between
          applications.</li>

          <li>Through Apple's Speech Manager Extension, Tex-Edit
          Plus will read the document to you. (It actually works,
          but the enunciation is a little flaky.)</li>

          <li>Lots of <b>Find, Replace, Change Case</b>
          capabilities.</li>

          <li>Conversion of text files between Macintosh, MS-DOS,
          and Unix systems.</li>

          <li>Special editing features, such as typographical
          (curly) quotes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The manual is very comprehensive and easy to understand.
        Using the margins and pagination that I normally use, it
        comes to 31 pages.</p>
