        <h3><a name="anchor1861825"></a>Letter from the Editor</h3>

        <p>The <a href="1997Q4.html">previous meeting notice</a>
        reflected my thoughts on the Mac situation at AlliedSignal
        as we enter 1998. In contrast, this year's MacWorld Expo
        was rather hopeful. While reflecting the troubles Apple has
        had the past two years, other indications pointed to the
        continuing strength of the Mac OS market, as over 50 new
        products were introduced to 68,000 attendees, including a
        major release of Microsoft Office.</p>

        <p>This is a short newsletter, primarily consisting of
        first-hand thoughts gathered during the San Francisco
        MacWorld Expo, January 6-9, 1998.</p>

        hit bottom?</h3>

        <p>Going into 1998, even the most hardcore Mac fans have to
        wonder if Apple has hit bottom - in dwindling sales,
        financial losses, layoffs, negative and often unjustified
        press beatings, and the unpredictability of Steve Jobs.
        Despite these misfortunes, Apple has a lot to be thankful
        for - the best operating systems in the industry, the best
        hardware and processor technology, dominance in some
        markets, the continued enthusiasm and loyalty of Mac
        customers everywhere, and the unpredictability of Steve
        Jobs.</p>

        <p>The high point of the Expo occurred during the first
        keynote. Interim CEO Steve Jobs accepted an <a href=
        "http://macworld.zdnet.com/ns-search/pages_collection/march.98/Feature.4182.html">
        Eddy Impact Award</a> for 1997. He proceeded to provide
        updates on Apple's new products, including the G3 Macs and
        QuickTime 3.0. Increased sales due to the <a href=
        "http://store.apple.com/">Apple Store</a> and <a href=
        "http://www.compusa.com/">CompUSA</a> were also
        highlighted. Their new manufacturing systems were able to
        overcome Apple's traditionally weak forecasting systems.
        From an estimate of 80,000 G3 machines, Apple actually
        shipped over 130,000 G3 machines. From 3% last October,
        CompUSA's Mac CPU sales last December was an amazing
        13%.</p>

        <p>Four showcase applications were demonstrated. The bulk
        of that time was taken up by Ben Waldman showing the much
        improved Microsoft Office 98, which for the first time, is
        ahead of the Windows version and offers many Mac-first and
        Mac-only features such as active assistants, QuickTime
        support, drag-and-drop across applications (not just
        Microsoft ones), self-repairing applications, and better
        performance than their Windows equivalents.</p>

        <p>At the end of the keynote, Jobs gave out the big
        <a href="http://product.info.apple.com/pr/press.releases/1998/q2/980114.pr.rel.q198.html">
        news</a> ­ <b><font size="+1">Apple made a $45 million
        dollar profit on $1.6 billion dollars in sales</font></b>,
        surprising financial analysts predicting a $20-$30 million
        dollar loss. This was greeted by a standing ovation and
        cheers. It is my firm belief that Jobs is the only one
        capable of leading Apple out of their current troubles and
        should drop the "Interim" from his title. The press
        conference later that day indicated that this profit is
        real and sustainable. We can only hope that the next
        quarter is just as good.</p>

        <h3><a name="anchor831401"></a><a href="#anchor1445970">On
        the Show Floor</a></h3>

        <p>After the keynote, I spent time roaming the huge South
        Hall and the smaller North Hall. For the first time in
        memory, the show space was appreciably smaller than
        previous years. Large sections of the aisles were empty,
        often filled by tables and chairs for attendees to sit and
        eat the overpriced food. There was a rather large section
        of South Hall that looked like a last minute cancellation
        from a <a href="http://www.powercc.com/">company</a> once
        considered the heir of Apple's guerrilla computing
        image.</p>

        <p>The show was small enough that I managed to cover all
        the booths on the first day. The second day was taken up
        with detailed visits to some booths and some shopping,
        marking the first time I finished the Expo in two days,
        instead of the usual three to four days. In a less than
        encouraging note, many of the vendors I was interested in
        did not show up. My interest in science/engineering
        software and programming tools was not addressed. With less
        emphasis on Rhapsody, some vendors decided to skip this
        year's show. In addition to seeing less of my favorite
        companies, there was more emphasis on Apple's core markets
        of education and publishing. I have some interest in
        companies like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>
        and <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Macromedia</a>,
        but I have seen most of them before and knew which ones to
        ignore, like the <a href=
        "http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> booth. I was just
        there long enough to get their free CD.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.be.com/"><b>Be</b></a> - After the
        takeover of Apple by NeXT, the importance and visibility of
        Be seems to have faded. However, their OS is quite a
        technological achievement, and their booth was filled with
        a few third party applications, and O'Reilly was selling
        the BeOS book.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.bzzzzzz.com/"><b>BeeHive</b></a>
        <b>ADB I/O</b> - a geek-lovers delight. A multi-function
        input/output box to connect your Mac to the real world.
        This device enables your Mac to control devices such as
        alarms and appliances, and receive readings from switches
        and thermostats.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.techworks.com/"><b>TechWorks
        Power3D</b></a> - This card does one thing and one thing
        only - it accelerates games written for the 3Dfx graphics
        chipset. Since the 3Dfx is the dominant acceleration method
        in the PC world, it makes it easier for developers to
        develop Mac versions able to take advantage of 3D effects.
        3Dfx-aware games include Quake, Myth, Carmageddon, and F-18
        Hornet 3.0.</p>

        <p><a href=
        "http://www.castlewoodsystems.com/"><b>Castlewood
        Systems</b></a> - This startup company introduced the Orb.
        For under $250, you get a removable 2.1 Gb drive (parallel
        port or SCSI-2). The great feature is that 2.1 Gb
        cartridges are expected to cost only $30, making it the
        most cost-effective hard disk storage system bar none.
        However, we will have to see whether the Orb's reliability
        and performance are as good as the hype claims them to
        be.</p>

        <p><b>Developer Central</b> - Again, DC was the place to be
        to get the latest product news and software upgrades for
        the year. I visited BareBones Software, makers of the
        awesome BBEdit text/HTML editor, Apple Computer developer
        relations to get some information about Rhapsody. They said
        that the Premiere release has now been renamed to "Customer
        Release 1" and should be available by the end of June. Many
        former NeXT developers were showing their Rhapsody
        applications at Developer Central. Credit goes to <a href=
        "http://www.xplain.com/">Xplain Corporation</a> for putting
        together another great pavilion.</p>

             alt="Apple Booth picture" /><b>Apple Booth</b> - This
             year's Apple Booth had the unmistakable influence of
             Steve Jobs - it exuded class and style. There were few
             walls and everything was easily accessible and seen.
             Instead of having two or three theaters showing off
             Apple technology, there was one large theater with a
             large enough screen and open space to accommodate
             overflow crowds. Demonstrations included MacOS,
             Rhapsody, and G3 machines. On either side were
             PowerBooks connected to the Apple Store, where you
             could place your orders. At one end of the booth was
             an artificial pond showcasing Newton's ability as a
             data acquisition platform. A very nice and informative
             layout, except for the hapless HR people recruiting
             for nonexistent jobs at Apple.</p>

        <p><a href=
        "http://www.newertech.com/index3.htm"><b>NewerTech</b></a>
        - The other recipient of the Eddy Impact award was Mike
        Rosenfelt, former marketing vice-president at Power
        Computing. NewerTech hired many of Power's engineers after
        the buyout; the result is the MaxPowr G3, the first
        affordable G3 upgrade card for NuBus PowerMacs
        (6100/7100/8100). Starting at $499, the cards run from 210
        to 240 MHz, and include a 512K or 1 Meg backside cache
        running at half the CPU speed. The booth exhibited PowerMac
        6100's running with a MacBench 4.0 score of over 800, eight
        times faster than with the original processor. The secret
        is that the backside cache running at 105 MHz more than
        compensates for the slow 30 MHz motherboard bus. This is
        certainly one upgrade I'm looking forward to - my four-year
        old Mac will be as fast as Apple's latest machines and
        still cost less.</p>

        <p><b>Apple/Microsoft party</b> - This was held the first

        the new relationship between Apple and Microsoft and to
        introduce MS Office 98 and <a href=

        County MUG, I was able to get a ticket to the event.
        Unfortunately, I was the only one, and the entire ASACMUG
        executive committee was denied entrance at the door. We
        then left and gave my one ticket to a desperate lady
        waiting outside. I heard it was a good party - even Steve
        Jobs spoke for a few minutes.</p>

        even with their current financial problems. I listened to a
        talk by Executive Director <a href=
        "mailto:Hal.GIbson@bmug.org">Hal Gibson</a>, as he
        explained how they got into their current mess of being
        over $100,000 in debt, although he was expecting that debt
        to be cut in half by the end of March. Many in the audience
        were optimistic and suggested many good ideas and it looks
        like BMUG will continue to provide their services, both in
        the Bay Area and around the world. I love their products,

        on the way back. I had never been to Cannery Row and the
        Monterey Bay Aquarium, and I found it to be very nice,
        relaxed, and devoid of tourists on a Thursday morning.
        Unfortunately, I was unable to see any sea otters due to El
        Ñino. I spent enough time in Monterey to cancel my planned
        drive through Big Sur and took US-101 instead. As I drove
        through the Gaviota curve, the temperature rose to a
        comfortable level and I was able to shed my sweaters. I was
        back in Southern California.</p>
