        <p><b>Presidents Column</b></p>

        <p>[sorry, our MUG President was out sick, no doubt due to
        all the stuff he bought and won at the expo! - Ed.]</p>
        <hr align="left" />

        <p>This is a short newsletter, primarily consisting of
        first-hand thoughts gathered during the San Francisco
        MacWorld Expo, held January 9-12, 1996.</p>

        <p>The area between the two main exhibit areas was composed
        of small rooms, some to handle expo administration, some
        were for coat and package checks. However, one of the rooms
        was the UGWUMP (User Group Welcoming, Unwinding, and
        Meeting Place) which happened to have a couple of public
        access Macs connected to the Internet, courtesy of <a href=
        "http://www.sirius.com/">Sirius Corporation</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="anchor818781"></a>Letter from the Show
        Floor</h3>

        <p><tt>Hi Ron and Roger:</tt></p>

        <p><tt>I guess you won't be able to make to the Expo. We
        had enough for an <a href=
        "http://bounce.to/asacmug/">ASACMUG</a> quorum and held a
        board meeting at the SF Hilton. Unfortunately, I had to
        leave early to catch the late train back home. Prior to
        that, <a href="http://www.apstech.com/">APS</a> threw their
        party - great folks with great products.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>As for Ron's request regarding Etherwave, Farallon
        seemed more interested in talking about their new ISDN and
        network modems. Etherwave transceivers are put on the same
        priority as LocalTalk connectors - just plug and play and
        minimize extensions to sort out conflicts.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>I won copies of PhotoStyler (a.k.a. Photoshop for
        Performa), Diskfit direct, and yet another copy of
        Deltagraph. Internet is the big theme of the show, Adobe
        was crowded, and every other booth had some sort of
        Internet tie-in. Novell/WordPerfect cancelled at the last
        minute, and once again, small companies and startups had
        the coolest software.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>The keynotes and expo in general has more people
        (72,000) but is less festive than last year. The fact that
        four Apple vice presidents announced their resignation
        yesterday did not help, nor is the possibility of more
        layoffs. The keynote by Jim Buckley (Apple USA) is on the
        internet at Apple's home page.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>It took me two days to see all the exhibits. The
        rest of the time will be spent buying "stuff", mostly books
        and reference material (I've lagged my programming skills
        for a whole year) and focusing more on specific
        vendors.</tt></p>

        <p><tt>And that's the latest from the show floor. I'll be
        seeing you next Tuesday.</tt></p>
        <hr align="left" />

        <h3><a name="anchor822053"></a>Macworld Expo - Reports</h3>

        <p>Macworld Expo, annual pilgrimage of the Mac faithful,
        opened in San Francisco to good weather. The lines at the
        coat checks were short, as rain decided to take a vacation
        and not bother the thousands of people here to see the
        latest Mac hardware and software.</p>

        <p>Initial estimates put attendance up 15% to 72,000 from
        the previous year. Post-show figures were later revised
        upwards to 80,000 for those who did not pre-register.</p>

        <p>To test the faith of attendees, and to makeup for the
        lack of rain, Apple announces bad news in buckets - a $70
        million loss for the quarter, margins below 20%, expected
        resignation of 5 vice presidents, and rumors of a massive
        layoff of 2,000 to 3,000 Apple employees (who should easily
        find good jobs elsewhere in Silicon Valley), and an
        eventual buyout by another company like <a href=
        "http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> or <a href=
        "http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>.</p>

        <p>You know what? We've heard this all before, and the
        press picks it up. The behavior is similar to that of a
        crowd gathering around a car accident victim. Jim Buckley,
        one of the few vice presidents who did not get the axe
        (yet), said as much during his keynote - Apple is here to
        stay, and with new technologies and alliances to keep it
        ahead of the Windows crowd. Sales increased by 11% and
        market share is now in double digits to 11%.</p>

        <p>For veteran Expo attendees, the setup is familiar - a
        large exhibit hall in the south end of Moscone Center and a
        smaller one in the north side to house smaller companies
        and the famous Developer Central. Between the two halls is
        the Apple Pavilion, occupying two large conference
        halls.</p>

        <p><b>Highlights:</b></p>

        <p><b>Iomega/SyQuest wars</b> - After the success of
        Iomega's Zip, the two masters of removable technology
        offered the next generation in storage. Both Iomega's Jaz
        and SyQuest's SyJet promise storage capacities in excess of
        1 gigabyte. Both drives are based on hard-platter
        Winchester technology. Drives are expected to sell for
        $600, with $200 cartridges. The SyJet has 30% more storage
        at 1.3 gigs. Availability is promised by the middle of this
        year.</p>

        <p><b>Web processing</b> - Basically, the whole Expo was
        connected to Internet. The most popular booth was the
        Apple/Adobe booth exhibiting PageMill and allowing users to
        create their own Web pages, albeit for only an hour. Other
        exhibitors with Web processors were drowned in the
        marketing hype, including two Windows developers - SoftQuad
        and Vermeer. Bill Gates must have been attending some
        presentations - Microsoft bought Vermeer's FrontPage soon
        after the Expo ended.</p>

        <p><b>Internet Service Providers</b> - National internet
        service providers (ISPs) announced Mac-specific products -
        <a href="http://www.netcom.com/">Netcom</a>, <a href=
        "http://www.earthlink.net/">Earthlink</a>, Pipeline all
        announced Mac products, albeit a few months or years after
        the same products were available under Windows. There
        should be some good competition to the larger online
        providers. The flat-rate pricing of these smaller ISPs will
        definitely put pressure on <a href=
        "http://www.aol.com/">AOL</a> and <a href=
        "http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</a>.</p>

        <p><b>Imaging</b> - <a href=
        "http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a> previewed new versions of
        Illustrator and PageMaker. Live Picture, a high-end
        Photoshop competitor, announced that they are no longer
        allied with <a href=
        "http://www.metatools.com/">MetaTools</a> and have formed a
        new company, with a <a href="#anchor831402">once and future
        CEO</a>.</p>

        <p><b>Games</b> - MacPlay had a large booth, showing their
        products. 1995 has been good for Mac gaming - we have all
        the good games available from the PC and then some
        (Marathon, Hornet). Also, input devices like game pads and
        joysticks are becoming popular.</p>

        <p><b>Developer Central</b> - new technologies were
        demonstrated- OpenDoc, QuickDraw 3D, Copland,
        Internet/Cyberdog, QuickTime in its various incarnations.
        Good place to buy books at a 20-30% discount, and the
        famous <a href="http://www.barebones.com/">BBEdit</a> "It
        Doesn't Suck" T-shirts. Anyone can spend a couple of hours
        getting familiar with OpenDoc in three seminar rooms, two
        by Apple and one by Symantec.</p>

        <p><b>New spreadsheet</b> - Casady &amp; Greene announced a
        $129 product that is an alternative to Excel. The
        spreadsheet itself is graphical - instead of just wrapping
        icons, menus, and toolbars around a grid of cells,
        C&amp;G's spreadsheet allows you to create blocks of cells,
        connected by operators and formulas. Although aimed for
        business users, the product has features for engineering
        analysis, record keeping, presentations, and other
        activities. It is expected to be available this March.</p>

        <p><b>Best hardware</b> - the <a href=
        "http://www.be.com/">BeBox</a>, which is neither a Mac nor
        an IBM compatible. Featuring efficient use of dual PowerPC
        processors, the BeBox has an advanced operating system that
        puts MacOS to shame the same way the MacOS puts Windows to
        shame, and very affordable at $1600. Unfortunately, you'd
        have to wait a while for new software - almost all of their
        sales are to potential software developers.</p>
        <hr align="left" />

        <h3><a name="anchor831402"></a>Macworld Expo -
        Ramblings</h3>

        <p><b>User group breakfasts</b> - Demos of Adobe PageMill,
        Newton OS 2.0, Claris FileMaker Pro 3.0, and Adobe
        PhotoStyler, with lots of free goodies and good news - the
        User Group Connection is now self-sufficient and
        profitable. Everyone got free copies of the latter two
        without documentation. <b>John Sculley</b>, once the
        unapproachable Apple CEO, was mingling with the crowd. He
        is head of Live Picture, Inc., but may also be gauging the
        Mac pulse to see if he can make a corporate comeback, given
        the bad financial news from Apple. The grand prize was a 4
        gigabyte drive donated by APS.</p>

        <p><b>User group room</b> had ISDN terminals, so attendees
        could check their voice and email during the show. I was
        able to use a Mac IIci to check my Audix mailbox and leave
        messages. It seems that even on vacation, everybody does a
        little work.</p>

        <p><b>ISDN connectivity</b> - during my stay in SF, I
        visited three apartments, and all had high-speed ISDN lines
        - talk about being technically hip. ISDN allows one to
        transmit/receive data four to eight times faster than the
        fastest 28.8 modems. Imagine being able to download a
        megabyte of data in two minutes and surf the Web quickly,
        without modem or firewall bottlenecks. As they say - all
        good things must come to an end - Pacific Bell found out
        they were charging too little ($100 setup fee, $70 a month,
        no usage fees after business hours) and has applied to the
        CPUC for a rate increase, including per-byte usage charges
        that should reduce the demand for ISDN. At least they offer
        ISDN, those of us with the misfortune to be GTE slaves...
        er... customers, don't even have an ISDN option for under
        $100 a month with a $200 setup fee.</p>

        <p><b>Novell</b> - also announced a bad financial quarter.
        In a kneejerk corporate response, their large exhibit booth
        was suddenly cancelled and Novell employees who had flown
        in for the show were recalled back to Utah. The only Novell
        person available was in the Apple Pavilion. He was handing
        out copies of the latest Netware 4.1 client for the
        Macintosh.</p>
        <hr align="left" />

        <h3><a name="anchor922732"></a>Macworld Expo -
        Epilogue</h3>

        <p>Finally, a few tidbits of information I was unable to
        categorize:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>DriveSavers showed a charred PC from which they
          recovered some data. A Mac attendee observed: <b>"It's a
          PC, it deserved to die"</b></li>

          <li>Bob Levitus, Power Computing evangelist, gave a
          reason why his company is selling SoftWindows:
          <b>"SoftWindows is the best way to run crummy software on
          great hardware"</b></li>

          <li>A software engineer from Sun says nice things about
          my favorite phone company: <b>"GTE - the telephone
          company from the 19th century trying to lead us into the
          21st"</b></li>

          <li><b>Best bag</b> - Iomega had the most visible bag for
          giving it out on the streets *before* entering the Expo.
          SyQuest for having the largest bag, and TechWorks for a
          cardboard box that sold out by the third day.</li>

          <li><b>Loudest booth</b> - Power Computing. In search for
          visibility, Power Computing took over the large booth
          vacated by Novell and played loud music and videos on a
          wall composed of sixteen 35" monitors. They offered a
          good grand prize - $1000 off the Mac-compatibles.</li>

          <li><b>Best prize</b> - 1996 Nissan Pathfinder by Digital
          Video, Inc. The latest Warren Miller ski film is 100%
          digital, produced on Macintosh computers using Adobe
          software.</li>

          <li><b>Cheapest booth</b> - ClubMac. They basically drove
          a big rig trailer right into Moscone center, opened the
          doors, and setup a retail operation. Like those stereo
          specials in the back of an alley, you can find good deals
          on Mac stuff - SoftWindows for $199 and an art tablet for
          $99.</li>

          <li><b>Busiest booth</b> - Adobe. In the past two years,
          Adobe has surpassed Microsoft to become the largest Mac
          software developer in unit sales. Adobe is committed to a
          Mac-first policy when it makes sense, and designs their
          products with the customer in mind. Their products are
          top-notch and get better with each revision. You can't
          possibly say that with Microsoft, even if you're a PC
          user. 1996 should be interesting as Adobe/Netscape takes
          on Microsoft in the Internet market.</li>

          <li><b>Loneliest booth</b> - Microsoft, whose idea of
          developing for the Mac is using a PC. Give me a
          break.</li>

          <li><b>Best fist fight</b> - someone was taking Marathon
          way too seriously at the Bungie booth.</li>
        </ul>
