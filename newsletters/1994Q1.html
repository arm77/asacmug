        <p>The December newsletter was well received with several
        people taking the time to comment on how useful it was.
        Unfortunately, since it was sent just before the Christmas
        break, some people may not have received our second
        electronic newsletter when they returned for the new year.
        If you did not get your copy, please send a request by
        e-mail to "ASACMUG" and we'll send you a copy.</p>

        <p>This newsletter is the January/February issue because
        the January issue was so late, we decided to combine it
        with the February issue. This month, the newsletter will
        feature the MacWorld Expo which was held in San Francisco
        on Jan. 5-8. At least seven MUG members attended the four
        day event (along with over 60,000 other Mac enthusiasts) at
        their own expense and time. The exhibition is held 2-3
        times a year, in San Francisco in January, Boston in August
        and this year in Washington D.C. on May 10-12 especially
        for those working for or with the government. If you can
        possibly attend, I encourage you to do so; you'll be amazed
        and glad you made it. Out of the seven members that
        attended, five were repeaters with with as many as six
        MacWorlds under their belts.</p>

        <p>Although Apple's new PowerMacs were not announced, they
        were "seen" throughout the show. Apparently, just before
        the show, Apple gave developers permission to show their
        native applications running on pre-production hardware as
        long as they didn't show the unreleased computers. This
        meant that we could see the monitors but the CPUs were kept
        under wraps. The performance of the new machines was very
        impressive with speeds ranging from 3 to 10 times the
        performance of the fastest Macs currently available. The
        new PowerMacs are expected to be released in mid-March and
        will be featured in the next newsletter.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in some special prices on Apple
        products check out the enclosures on Apple closeouts and
        refurbished products. Remember, the February specials must
        be ordered before the end of February and the March
        specials are only available during March.</p>

        <p>As mentioned in the last newsletter, the MacWorld Expo
        was held the first week of January in San Francisco. Over
        60,000 people attended the show marking the first decade of
        Macintosh computing and ushering in the next generation of
        Macs based on the PowerPC microprocessor.</p>

        <p>This issue contains short descriptions of interesting
        products and show events as seen by those at AlliedSignal
        who attended the show. It also contains a description of
        the contents of the ASACMUG Software Library and a
        description of how to access our Library.</p>

           Expedition to MacWorld Expo
        <br />
        Ron Keating</b></p>

        <p>Everyone who goes to MacWorld Expo in San Francisco
        brings back personal trophies. These are some of my
        trophies from the most recent exposition.</p>

        <p>One of the nice things about computer stuff is the price
        is always dropping. Ever since I read Randy Singer's
        article "Which High Speed Modem?" in the Fall 1993 BMUG
        Newsletter, I dreamed of owning a Teleport Gold 14.4 kbps
        Fax/Modem from Global Village Telecommunication. It used
        the AT&amp;T chip set that Randy said was so much better
        than the Rockwell one; it had the best Fax software, and,
        as Randy said, he never heard a complaint from a Teleport
        user. The only problem was the $369 mail order price. But
        with computer stuff you don't have to wait long until the
        price falls to what you are more willing to pay.</p>

        <p>The special Mac World Expo price was less than $250, so
        I bought two of them. One for me and one for my girlfriend,
        so that we can Fax messages to each other. Besides, Michael
        Fraase in his book <i>The Mac Internet Tour Guide</i> says
        that to access the Internet by SLIP or PPP, you need to use
        at least a V.32 9600 baud modem, although he highly
        recommends a V.32bis/V.42bis 14,400 modem. Now, I am ready
        for the Internet. After using the modem for two weeks, I
        liked it so much, that I decided I couldn't live without
        one on each of my machines. I found a deal through Computer
        Town, a Massachusetts mail order firm with no California
        sales tax, that nearly matched the Mac World Expo price,
        and bought a third Teleport Gold to use with my office Mac.
        For this review, I will repeat part of Randy's BMUG article
        on the modem, although you really should read the entire
        BMUG Newsletter, which is excellent.</p>

        <p>"This modem is the closest thing there is to a
        plug-and-play high speed modem for the Macintosh. It comes
        with everything that you need right in the box. It is
        reported to be dead reliable and many people find the
        included Fax software to be the easiest to use of any Fax
        software available for the Macintosh. ZTerm is included; so
        it isn't necessary to purchase it separately to obtain a
        data software package that includes the Zmodem protocol.
        I've never heard a complaint from a teleport user. Ask them
        how well it performs and they just reply that they plugged
        it in and never had a complaint afterward. I have to assume
        then that this modem rarely has a problem connecting to
        services even when encountering bad phone connections.
        Global Village's service is also reputed to be impeccable.
        A unique and valuable feature of this modem is that it will
        allow you to continue to do your work in another
        application while simultaneously sending or receiving a
        Fax."<i>[That last comment sounds like a bit of TQS to
        me.]</i></p>

        <p>In addition to the two modems, I bought a copy of
        Fontographer and four books at Mac World Expo. The Expo is
        an excellent place to browse for books. This years finds
        were (1) <i>The Little Mac Word Book</i>, by Helmut Kobler;
        (2) <i>ICONS for the Masses,</i> by David Lai, with over
        1,000 icons and ICON Wizard software on disk; <i>Photoshop
        for Macintosh</i>, by Elaine Weinmann and Peter Lourekas,
        and last, but not least the <i>Internet Starter Kit</i>, by
        Adam C. Engst, with a disk that has all of the software
        needed for MacTCP access to the Internet.</p>

        <p>The last book brings me to something that is getting a
        lot of attention lately. That is the Internet. Armed with
        the two Internet books mentioned above and the article in
        the Spring 1994 BMUG Newsletter (also available at MacWorld
        Expo) titled "The Last Internet Article You'll Ever Read
        (On paper anyway)" by Andrew Tonkin, I hope to be hooked up
        to the Internet graphically, clicking and dragging the
        familiar Mac way, in time for the next ASACMUG newsletter
        with my own PPP account. As Andrew says in his article,
        "get out there and get on the Internet...and stop reading
        about it already!"</p>

        <p>One of the best things you can do with your money is to
        join BMUG. The BMUG Newsletter alone is 544 pages, contains
        78 full length articles, and is published twice a year;

             PowerPC
        <br />
        Alex Morando</b>

        <p>This year's MacWorld Expo in San Francisco had the usual
        elements of any computer trade show - large booths,
        software upgrades, free pins, bags for carrying off product
        literature and if you're lucky, free 170 meg LaCie hard
        disks. However, there was a pervasive air of both hope and
        uncertainty as Apple begins the transition to the PowerPC
        processor for all future Macintosh computers. Software
        running on the PowerPC was demonstrated; it lived up to
        it's claims of being up to 4 to 10 times faster than the
        fastest Mac and PCs of today. Over 100 PowerPC Macs,
        discreetly covered in plain brown wrappers or hidden under
        booths, were on the show floor for users to try out. The
        first three Power Macintosh computers are due to be
        released in March, with prices ranging from $2000 for a 60
        MHz CPU to $4500 for an 80MHz CPU. All prices include 8
        megs of RAM (minimum), monitor, and keyboard.</p>

        <p><i>PowerPC Conference</i></p>

        <p>One day before the show, an entire day was dedicated to
        the PowerPC and how it would impact individual users, small
        businesses, large businesses, and educational markets.
        Although the PowerPC promises large increases in speed and
        overall performance, the biggest concern was for
        compatibility with existing software and the existing
        environments of prospective users. The feeling at the end
        of the show was that although software written for PowerPC
        is a good reason to buy PowerMacs, a better and more
        compelling reason is to be able to run the existing
        Macintosh software base and to minimize the transition
        difficulties in bringing one to your home or office.</p>

        <p><i>RAMDoubler</i></p>

        <p>One of the best products of the show was RAMDoubler by
        Connectix. As an Extension, it modifies the way the Mac
        handles memory and effectively doubles it. For example, if
        you have 5 megs of RAM on your Mac, adding RAMDoubler will
        effectively give you 10 megs of RAM. However, if you use
        only one application (like Photoshop or XPress) for which
        you dedicate large amounts of RAM, it will not work.
        RAMDoubler is suited for those who work with many
        applications and transfer data between them. It is an
        all-or-nothing proposition : if RAMDoubler does not work
        for you, Connectix offers a 30-day money back
        guarantee.</p>

        <p><i>Fodor's '94 Travel Manager</i></p>

        <p>While not strictly for Macintosh, this Newton
        application may be useful for people on the go. For each
        major city in the U.S., it shows over 500 locations of
        special attractions, restaurants, travel routes, and other
        information essential for the business or personal
        traveler. You simply click on where you are and click on
        where you want to go; Travel Manager will find out the best
        route. Write the word "Seafood" and it will list seafood
        restaurants, along with location, price, and rating
        (according to Fodor). [There was a lot of Newton activity
        at the show, and over 100 Newton applications were being
        shown in the Apple booth. Apple and Sharp have announced
        total sales of 100,000 Newtons during the period from
        August-December 1993.]</p>

        <p><i>DayStar PowerPro(TM)</i></p>

        <p>Apple has announced both logic board and PDS (processor
        direct slot) card upgrades for certain Macintosh models.
        Apple has also licensed it's PowerPC ROMs to DayStar for an
        additional line of PowerPC accelerator cards. Many of these
        cards are designed for Macs for which Apple is not planning
        to supply upgrades. This way, many of those who own older
        machines like the IIcx, IIci, and Quadra 700 can enjoy the
        benefits of PowerPC. One benefit of the DayStar PowerPro is
        that the speed is independent of the motherboard, while the
        Apple card can only run at twice the motherboard frequency.
        DayStar cards will run at their rated speed independent of
        the motherboard. Prices will start at $500 for a low-end
        50MHz model; prices for other cards will be set by
        March.</p>

        <p><i>Replica</i></p>

        <p>Electronic document interchange is made easier by
        Replica(TM) by Farallon. It is a method by which documents
        can be exchanged between different people without all of
        them requiring to have the same application. Available for
        both Macintosh and Windows, documents can be reviewed,
        annotated, and assembled across a network. Font problems
        and picture formats are resolved by having font and picture
        information embedded within the Replica document. Replica
        competes with two other electronic interchange
        technologies: Adobe Acrobat(TM) and Common Ground (TM).
        Compared with Acrobat, Replica has modest RAM and hard disk
        requirements, and does not require you to replace your
        TrueType fonts with ATM Type 1 fonts. ASACMUG plans to use
        Replica in future issues of this newsletter.</p>

        <p><i>DeltaGraph Pro 3.0</i></p>

        <p>The latest upgrade to the leading charting program by
        DeltaPoint has many added features, chart types, and an
        overhaul of the user interface. Users who upgrade from 2.0
        are advised to take some time learning the new version.
        Many of the ways in which graphs are made are different.
        For example, since there are now so many chart types, a
        Chart Advisor guides you in creating your chart, asking the
        type of audience, the amount of detail, the kind of data,
        and the complexity of the chart. Also, the modal dialog
        boxes shrink when you choose "Show", so you can actually
        see what is happening to the chart. The program also has a
        whole set of new features: a command bar, AppleScript
        support, multiple documents, and charts useful in TQM
        (Pareto, range, histogram, and ogive).</p>

        <p><i>e*World</i></p>

        <p>Apple has created a new division, Apple Online Services,
        to create and operate a new online service called e*World.
        Designed to compete with other services like Compu$erve and
        America Online, e*World offers a graphical interface whose
        metaphor is that of a village. Different areas of the
        village mean different things: a house with picket fences
        contains your personal files and settings; the mail truck
        delivers your electronic mail. A shopping center allows
        retailers to offer their products, and an office building
        offers banking and other financial services. Other services
        will be available as e*World expands. It is estimated to be
        operational by March for Macintosh and by May for Windows.
        The monthly fee will be $8.95 per month with two free
        hours. Additional time will be charged by the minute.</p>

        <p><i>BeingThere/BeingThere PRO</i></p>

        <p>A lot of videoconferencing tools were shown at MacWorld,
        but this product from Intelligence At Large is interesting
        since it is a software-only solution. While other solutions
        require the purchase of expensive boards and hardware,
        BeingThere only requires a camcorder for people that want
        to be "seen"; others can participate via the built-in
        microphone or via the electronic white board for markup and
        discussion. Using AV Macs is very effective in this case
        since camcorders can be directly plugged to the back of the
        Mac. Each person participating in the teleconference is
        shown in a small window; those without cameras are shown as
        generic people icons or as a static picture. Information
        can be exchanged via video, audio, a common white board, or
        through shared documents (i.e. allowing others to see that
        Excel spreadsheet you've been working on). There is, of
        course, a tradeoff between cost, quality, and response time
        in using BeingThere. It is very useful for small, informal
        working conferences; it is less useful for large
        presentations to the CEO.</p>

        <br />
        Mike Quan</b></p>

        <p>One of the most exciting announcements was the
        introduction of the new Apple Citibank credit card. Any
        purchases using this card will generate a credit that may
        be used toward Apple Computer products. The credit ranges
        from 2.5% for the first $3,000 of purchases and 5% for
        additional purchases up to $500 per year. Credits are good
        for 36 months so a person could accumulate up to $1500
        worth of credits. Unfortunately, there is an annual fee of
        $20 which is waived for the first year. Personally, I've
        checked my family's credit card habits and I should be able
        to get the maximum credit each year so the annual fee is
        not a problem. If you wish to get an Apple VISA or Apple
        Mastercard card, call Citibank at 1-800-374-9999 ext.

        may have noticed messages sent to all Microsoft Mail users
        regarding user group activities or other broadcast messages
        of a non-broadcast nature. ASACMUG apologizes for any

        our inital mailing.</p>

        <p>For those familiar with Microsoft Mail, the default

        users on the AlliedSignal mail network.</p>

        <p>This problem can be remedied by first determining the
        audience of your message. If it is not a global broadcast,
        you can do one of two things:</p>

           Update</b></p>

        <p>Listed below are some interesting items now found in the
        ASACMUG software library. This is not a complete list by
        any means. Send email to (ASACMUG) if you wish to obtain a
        listing of all available items. If you are connected to the
        ASAC network, you can obtain the software as follows:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>1) Open the Chooser, select the TOR-ASE-ENG-ETHERTALK
          zone, and double click on the Engineering KeyServer file
          server (see below):</li>

          <li>Logon as Guest and click on the OK button.</li>

          <li>You are now at the top level of the ASACMUG BBS. All
          software can be found under the Software Library
          folder.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><img src="1994Q1_assets/94q14.gif"
             width="464"
             height="313"
             naturalsizeflag="3"
             align="bottom" /></p>

        <p>Almost all of the files are in self-extracting format,
        usually denoted with a .sea at the end of the filename.
        Just copy the files you want from the BBS to your desktop
        and double-click on them. Files without a .sea suffix can
        be decompressed using Stuffit Expander, found in the Public
        Domain/Shareware:Utilities folder.</p>

        <p><i>And now the list:</i></p>

        <p>Under the Anti-Virus folder is <b>Disinfectant 3.3</b>,
        which is the latest version of the best anti-virus utility
        for the Macintosh.</p>

        <p>ASACMUG is authorized to distribute certain Apple system
        software; it can be found under the Apple Software folder.
        As an example, we have the <b>HyperCard 2.1 Player</b>
        which allows you to run HyperCard stacks, <b>QuickTime
        1.6.1</b>, Apple's multimedia extension allowing you to
        play movies and sounds, and <b>System Tune-Up 1.1.1</b>
        which fixes bugs in Systems 7.0 and 7.0.1.</p>

        <p>In the ASACMUG Files folder is an (unofficial)
        AlliedSignal startup screen. Just name this file
        "StartupScreen" and place in your System Folder. Reboot
        your Mac and see what happens!</p>

        <p>The largest folder in the BBS is the Public
        Domain/Shareware folder. Under the Applications subfolder
        are some programs that are very good for doing specific
        jobs. We have <b>BBEdit Lite 2.3.2</b> which is an
        excellent TeachText replacement and <b>HP calc! 2.0</b>,
        which replaces the Calculator desk accessory. It is useful
        for those familiar with RPN notation.</p>

        <p>Under the Data subfolder, we have the <b>ASE Phones</b>
        HyperCard stack, listing the names, locations, and phone
        numbers of all ASE employees. The file
        <b>MacHistory.sea</b> is a good pictorial history of every
        Macintosh ever produced</p>

        <p>The Utilities subfolder has a lot of interesting
        programs that let you customize your Mac for more
        efficiency or just to make it fun to work on. <b>Default
        Folder 2.46.sea</b> allows you to quickly navitage folders
        while in the Open/Save dialog box. <b>Décor.sea</b> puts
        pictures on your desktop instead of boring repetitive
        patterns. <b>Stuffit Expander 307.sea</b> is an all-purpose
        decompression utility that can decompress Stuffit, Compact
        Pro, and AppleLink files; simply drop the compressed file
        onto the Stuffit Expander icon and it will do the rest.</p>
