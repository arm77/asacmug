        <p><b>The Immediate Future - MacWorld San Francisco</b></p>

        <p><b>Kevin Elwell</b> (<b>TORMP101.ElwellK)</b></p>

        <p>As mentioned in the last newsletter, MacWorld is a trade
        exposition sponsored by MacWorld Magazine that is held
        bi-annually in both San Francisco and Boston. It's a great
        place to see the latest developments in both hardware and
        software that are specific to your interests on the Mac.
        There are training sessions, as well as many interesting
        forums and discussions.</p>

        <p>Every year we usually get together and go for two
        reasons. One is obvious - to learn about what's new. The
        other is to capitalize on the best deals that can be had,
        which this year were fairly great. One of our users spent
        over $700 on hardware and software, and saved probably
        three times that much.</p>

        <p><b>What Was Hot?</b></p>

        <p>This is a question that many will answer differently
        because it all depends on your perspective. Everyone goes
        to MacWorld with different interests, so most of us split
        up and get together later to compare notes. If you read
        Adam Engst's TidBITS, you will have noticed that because he
        is the author the "The Internet Starter Kit" he saw many
        things there that were related to networking and to netting
        [except for the QuickCam digital camera in this issue]. You
        may notice that my review is somewhat biased towards
        graphic applications. Anyway, with that qualifier in place
        here are my notable show pics:</p>

        <p><b>Software:</b></p>

        <p><u>Emailer</u> - in my humble opinion, this should get
        the award for the best new software product introduced at
        the show. Basically they've put a front end on all your
        various e-mail services (Compuserve, America On-Line,
        Internet, GEnie, Prodigy, etc., ad nauseam) and this thing
        will go out and get mail and upload/download whatever you
        assign it to. It is sort of like Compuserve Navigator in
        that regard, only it works with anyone's service. It'll be
        great for people with multiple service providers.</p>

        <p><u>Lightning Draw GX</u> - this product was interesting
        in that it was the first I've seen to take advantage of the
        new features offered in System 7.5's GX technology. I'd
        have to say that there were some very interesting features
        there that PostScript applications just don't have yet. It
        worked more like a cross between a vector-based graphics
        program like ClarisDraw (formerly MacDraw) and a
        bit-diddler like Photoshop.</p>

        <p><u>XRes</u> by Fauvre - this product has subsequently
        been written up in MacWEEK, but before the show nobody knew
        what it was or what it was good for. It's too bad for them
        too, because I think this one is today where Photoshop will
        be tomorrow. It's kind of a cross between Photoshop and
        Live Picture, but with a $600 show price (retail $795). It
        takes all the commands you give it and stores them to
        compile the effects on the image at a later time. It was
        fast, and very easy to manipulate very large files, unlike
        Photoshop.</p>

        <p><u>A-10 Attack!</u> - this piece was done by Eric
        "Hellcats Over the Pacific" Parker. This is perhaps the
        most realistic flight simulator of any I've seen. If you're
        into flying, and in particular into flying combat aircraft,
        this is the one to own. They were demonstrating it with a
        real tactical pilot using both a stick, a throttle module
        and foot-pedals. They were running with three monitors on a
        Quadra 800 and flying formation with another A-10. It was
        incredibly realistic!</p>

        <p><u>Pierce Print Tools</u> - this lets many applications
        take advantage of GX technology and really adds some
        sensible functionality to the Apple standard print dialog
        box. It also adds some neat features to non-GX standard
        applications.</p>

        <p><u>Personal Secretary</u> by Articulate Systems - this
        was by far the most practical and neatest integration of
        voice technology I've seen thus far. Articulate is perhaps
        the leader in this field for bringing a voice interface
        down to the level of the masses. You could dictate (albeit
        slowly) without training your voice and have this dude
        actually type a letter for you. For those who are keyboard
        impaired, this is certainly a viable alternative, although
        you'll spend more than $2K.</p>

        <p><u>WordPerfect</u> - if you wanted a free umbrella (and
        you would've needed one - it never stopped raining) the
        Word Perfect booth was the place to be. You had to wait a
        very long time, but the demonstration was worth it. They've
        really improved the product. It's faster, has support for
        GX, AppleEvents, Drag-N-Drop, and has a better interface
        than ever before. Best of all, their show price was only
        $79.</p>

        <p><b>Hardware:</b></p>

        <p><img src="1995Q1_assets/95q12.gif"
             width="320"
             height="240"
             naturalsizeflag="3"
             align="right" /><u>Zip Drive</u> - most pundits give
             the nod to the new zip drive from Iomega. It's a
             little larger than an external SuperDrive (floppy),
             and the disks will hold 100 MB and are priced at
             $19.95. The drive itself will only set you back about
             $200, so there's a good chance that this will receive
             wide acceptance among Mac and PC users. The picture
             below compares the relative sizes of a 100 meg Zip and
             a regular 1.4 meg floppy disk.</p>

        <p><br /></p>

        <p><u>Visioneer</u> <u>PaperPort</u> - I saw this
        advertised and really wasn't that interested in what
        appeared to be a re-packaged scanner. However, this product
        was much more than meets the eye. It is low-end version of
        Wang's high end imaging technology. Best part about this
        was its speed (up to 12 pages a minute) and seamless
        integration with the Mac O/S. After loading the software
        and plugging in the hardware via the ADB, all one has to do
        to "get a doc into the Mac" is to feed the paper into the
        device. After that you have the choice to fax, print, or
        whatever to the scanned image. It worked very quickly,
        which is very uncharacteristic of most scanners. For $300
        it would be a steal for someone running an office out of
        the home. This gets my award for best new hardware
        product.</p>

        <p><u>QuickCam</u> - people were lined up 10 deep to buy a
        $100 video camera that works with the Mac. This little
        ball-like lens sits atop your computer, has a built in
        microphone, and takes black and white images at the rate of
        15 frames/second. You can create your own QuickTime movies,
        or just do a real quick set of stills. It was very easy to
        use and the price was right - Connectix couldn't take the
        money from people fast enough. [A more detailed review
        appears later this issue - ed.]</p>

        <p><u>Liberty 4.2 GB Hard Drives</u> - Liberty was selling
        the smallest 4.2 Gigabyte hard drive I've seen. It was very
        light as well. Not cheap, but if you want to put everything
        in one place and take it with you, this was the only way to
        go.</p>

        <p>Trends: seems like I saw about ten vendors selling
        paging or mobile service links via the Mac. Mobile
        communications are certainly looking more and more
        mainstream. RAID and higher-end disk storage devices were
        becoming more prevalent as well.</p>

        <p>I hope you found something interesting above, and that
        you'll consider joining ASACMUG in San Francisco next
        January.</p>

           MS Mail
        <br />
        Alex Morando</b></p>

        <p>Businessess are becoming more electronically connected,
        and workers at AlliedSignal are no exception. This article
        will explain how to be compatible and cooperative with the
        dominant mail standard at AlliedSignal - Microsoft Mail.
        With these tips and a little practice, those of us using
        Macs can be 100% compatible with those who are using PCs
        (at least until they replace your desktop Mac with a PC).
        Since the Mac is the minority, the burden of compatbility
        falls on us. This tutorial assumes that users know how to
        address their email messages, attach files, and maintain
        their Address Books.</p>

        <p><b>Finding the address</b><img src=
        "1995Q1_assets/95q13.gif"
             width="97"
             height="315"
             naturalsizeflag="3"
             align="right" /></p>

        <p>The first thing is to find out the address of the person
        you want to send documents to. All MS Mail addressess are
        specified using the DGN.DEN convention - the DGN refers to
        the "post office" holding that person's mailbox, and the
        DEN is the person's name from the post office's point of
        view. Most of the time, the DGN is an eight-character
        specification of the SBU site, and the mailbox number of
        that post office. For example, TORMP104 is the 104th
        mailbox in Torrance, while TMPMP001 is the 1st mailbox in
        Tempe. The DEN is usually the first six characters of the
        person's last name plus his or her initial. A Jim Morrision
        who works at the 67th mailbox in Torrance would thus have a
        DGN.DEN of TORMP067.MorrisJ.</p>

        <p>The DGN.DEN can usually be determined from the mail you
        receive from that person. If you are initiating the
        message, you may have to search for that person's name.
        This is done by using the SSW Directory Search form shown
        below. From the main MS Mail window, scroll down and click
        on the SSW Dir? form.</p>
        <hr />

        <p>SSW Directory Search (<b>bottom</b> button - see
        right)</p>
        <hr />

        <p>Fill in the person's last name in the space provided and
        send the message. An automatic response will be delivered
        to your mailbox within 24 hours, and should provide the
        DGN.DEN of the person you're looking for. You may add this
        name to your personal mailbox, or have MS Mail add it for
        you automatically.</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="1995Q1_assets/95q14.gif"
             width="100%"

             align="bottom" />
        <br />
        <b>SSW Directory Search Form (entering last name)</b></p>

        <p><b>Formatting your document</b></p>

        <p>There are two steps necessary to make your documents
        readable by PCs. First, you have to save it in a
        PC-compatible format. Since MS Office is the standard,
        there is no need to worry about compatibility, since files
        saved in Word 5.1/6.0, Excel 4.0/5.0, and PowerPoint
        3.0/4.0 are compatible between Macs and PCs without having
        to use special translators like MacLink Plus or Apple File
        Exchange. Those who use other programs have to find ways to
        write in any of the MS Office formats. For example, both
        WordPerfect and MacWrite Pro can create Word files using
        Claris' XTND technology. For simple documents, the
        translation is perfect; more complex documents may require
        additional work to make them fully compatible.</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="1995Q1_assets/95q15.gif"
             width="320"
             height="241"
             naturalsizeflag="3"
             align="bottom" />
        <br />
        <b>Sample XTND dialog box
        <br />
        (saving as a Word document)</b></p>

        <p>Other file formats that are PC-compatible include TIFF
        and EPS for graphics, Text (with DOS linefeeds) for
        text-only data, and DBF for database data. There are a
        large number of other cross-compatible file formats, and
        MacLink translation software may be necessary for some of
        the less-common formats.</p>

        <p>The second step is to rename your document. Unlike Macs,
        PCs are limited to an 8.3 character filename. Shorten your
        filename to this standard. For example, your Word file
        "Letter to Jim Jan 95" might be renamed to "LTRJIM95.DOC"
        before sending it via MS Mail. One technique I use is to
        make a copy of my document and rename <b>that</b> copy
        before sending it as an MS Mail attachment. This way, I am
        constrained by a descriptive 31-character filename instead
        of an 8.3 filename.</p>

        <p><b>Sending your document</b><img src=
        "1995Q1_assets/95q16.gif"
             width="88"
             height="315"
             naturalsizeflag="3"
             align="right" /></p>

        <p>One common mistake is to send attached documents using
        the default Note or 80 column forms. <b>Documents sent
        using these forms may not reach PC users correctly.</b> 1)
        Scroll down the forms list and select the Message form.
        This allows you to send your documents in PC format. 2)
        Click on the To: field to specify your recipient, 3) write
        your message in the (small) text box in the lower left, 4)
        click on the Attach: button to select files you want to
        send. 5) Look at the three file format buttons on the lower
        right corner and select the button titled "Mail as a DOS
        file". 6) You can now click on the Send button to mail your
        files.</p>

        Savannah (GA) MUG</b></p>

        <p><i>"People add value to electronic documents with
        bookmarks, links, and jumps that are lost when they are
        printed." -- John Warnock, Adobe Systems Inc., interviewed
        in Wired magazine.</i></p>

             height="32"
             naturalsizeflag="3"
             align="left" /> The quality and accessibility of
             paperless documents has moved up a notch with the
             release of Adobe Acrobat 2.0. Acrobat technology had
             already established itself as the most accurate of the
             "digital paper" formats, and the latest version adds a
             slew of new features to the mix: a free Reader,
             security, and improved navigation.</p>

        <p>Acrobat technology allows for the creation and
        electronic distribution of documents created from any
        application--word processors, page layout programs,
        spreadsheets, and databases. Any document that can be
        printed can be created in Acrobat format. The person
        receiving the file can view the document on-screen or print
        it without the need for the original program, the fonts
        used to create it, or the associated graphics files.
        Furthermore, Acrobat technology spans most computer
        platforms, including Mac, Windows, DOS, or UNIX.</p>

        <p>Documents can be electronically distributed without the
        need for costly printing, bulky mailing, or mechanical
        duplication.</p>

             height="32"
             naturalsizeflag="3"
             align="left" />The addition of a free Reader for PDF
             (portable digital format) documents will allow Adobe
             to regain some of the market which was earlier lost to
             the competition. Previously, anyone who wanted to view
             or print an Acrobat document had to purchase a copy of
             the Acrobat Reader. Other companies allowed the
             embedding of a viewing mechanism within the document
             itself. This approach proved to be popular in the
             marketplace, despite the fact that documents with
             embedded viewers were significantly larger than their
             Acrobat counterparts. By providing a single (free)
             viewer, the Acrobat system avoids the duplication of
             having a viewer embedded in each document.</p>

        <p>Acrobat Reader 2.0 will be available free from online
        services, or directly from Adobe for a small shipping and
        handling fee. (SMUG members will be able to obtain the
        Reader at monthly meetings or from our local bulletin
        board.) In a somewhat surprising development, Apple has
        announced that the new Reader will be pre-installed on the
        hard drives of all Macs with over 5MB of RAM. Whatever the
        motivation behind this move, it is certain to make the
        Acrobat system more of a standard.</p>

        <p>Another factor which contributes to the compact size of
        Acrobat documents is the built-in compression offered by
        the Acrobat Distiller program. In our tests, distilled
        Acrobat files were often one-third the size of Common
        Ground files. In fact, distilled files are often smaller
        than the original document files from which they are
        created.</p>

        <p>Security. If you want to restrict the privileges for an
        Acrobat document, you can choose from several options when
        you save the file. You can enable or disable the following:
        printing, changing the document, adding and changing notes,
        and selecting text and graphics.</p>

        <p>Searching is a major new capability. You can perform
        full-text searches across multiple documents--even those on
        a network. The drawback for Mac users is that the program
        which creates the catalog file is only available on the
        Windows platform. We hope that this oversight is quickly
        remedied.</p>

        <p>Navigation. Cross-document links allow a document's
        creator to create links that will open other Acrobat
        files.</p>

        <p>There are several new viewing options. Fit Visible
        automatically chooses the appropriate zoom level to display
        only the visible elements on a page, thus eliminating empty
        white space in margins. The new Full Screen mode displays
        documents without toolbars or other user interface
        elements. This mode is great for making presentations.
        Preferences allow for automatic or manual advancing of
        pages.</p>

        <p>There are many other improvements in Acrobat 2.0--more
        than we can deal with here. All of these add up to an
        improvement in the way we can create and use paperless
        documents by helping us to create documents more quickly,
        more efficiently, and to view and/or print them with an
        ease heretofore unknown.</p>

        <p><b>The Components</b></p>

        <p>Acrobat Reader software is the tool for viewing,
        navigating, and printing electronic documents. The program
        lets users display and print documents in the PDF format
        and use navigation features such as article threads,
        annotations and links. Versions of Acrobat Reader run on
        DOS, Windows, Macintosh and UNIX systems. Acrobat Reader
        will be included with all Adobe Acrobat 2.0 products and is
        available free of charge from on-line services, the
        Internet and from Adobe for a nominal shipping and handling
        fee.</p>

        <p>Adobe Acrobat 2.0 software enables users to create PDF
        files with PDF Writer from any standard desktop
        application.</p>

        <p>Acrobat Exchange 2.0 lets users view and print PDF files
        as well as annotate, build navigational links into and add
        security controls to PDF files.</p>

        <p>Acrobat Search is a new feature in Acrobat Exchange that
        lets users retrieve PDF files by conducting full-text
        searches of indexed PDF files. With the TOPIC(TM) Search
        Engine, licensed from Verity, Inc., users can search full
        document texts--including charts, graphs, and captions--by
        key words, phrases, proximity, word stemming, synonym, and
        other parameters.</p>

        <p>Acrobat Distiller converts any PostScript language files
        created with DOS, Windows, Macintosh, or UNIX applications
        into PDF files. It can be used with files from drawing,
        page layout or image editing programs; documents containing
        high-resolution or Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) language
        artwork or images; or documents containing complex blends
        or gradient fills.</p>

        <p>Acrobat Catalog creates full-text indexes for
        collections of PDF files shared over a network of Macintosh
        and Windows users, automatically building on-line indexes
        of all PDF files. This enables users to manage large
        volumes of information on a network. (Only available on
        Windows format.)</p>

        <p>Last December, Microsoft announced that the latest
        version of MS-Office (4.2) is finally available for the
        Mac. Office includes Excel 5.0, Word 6.0, and PowerPoint
        4.0 (MS-Mail remains at version 3.1). It came to the local
        ASACMUG office on 29 high-density floppy disks (the
        PowerMac version comes on 39 disks). Updated versions of
        Excel (5.0a) and Word (6.0a) are due by the end of March,
        1995.</p>

        <p>Since AlliedSignal has a site license for Office, and
        that most people would rather not spend an hour or more
        installing from floppies, ASACMUG has made the network
        installation of MS-Office available through the ASACMUG
        BBS.</p>

        <p>60 megabytes of free disk space and 8 megs of RAM is
        required for a normal installation. Quit all programs
        except the Finder. If you do not have the required disk
        space, you may install only certain programs instead of the
        entire Office suite. The upgrade is worthwhile if you have
        at least a IIci (25MHz 68030). It will run on LCs and
        IIsi's, but the performance and speed will leave much to be
        desired.</p>

        <p>Logon to the Engineering Keyserver (on the

        <br />

        <br />

        <p>The FCC approved it just a tad too late for most stores
        to stock up for holiday gift sales, but the QuickCam video
        camera for Macintosh computers should prove a winner for
        Connectix. It's the successful software company's first
        venture into the peripheral market.</p>

        <p>QuickCam has a retail price of $149, though it sells for
        about $99 through dealers and some mail-order outlets. In
        fact, just about the only users who received their cameras
        in time for holiday gift-giving are those who ordered from
        MacConnection at the Macworld Expo in August. The backlog
        should be clearing up as you read this, though a new run of
        orders at January's Macworld Expo may set them behind
        again.</p>

        <p>Suddenly, desktop video is within reach of almost any
        Mac user's budget. A small grey sphere about the size of a
        billiard ball, with its own removable triangular stand,
        QuickCam connects to any QuickTime-compatible Macintosh
        (one with 68020 processor or better) through either
        built-in serial port [printer or modem]. Since no
        specialized cards are required, it doesn't matter whether
        your Mac has NuBus slots, multimedia slots, or anything
        else - just a free modem port or printer port. Almost any
        PowerBook is a perfect candidate.</p>

        <p><img src="1995Q1_assets/95q113.gif"

             align="left" /><b>[Actual diameter is 2.2
             inches]</b></p>

        <p>The first-generation QuickCam provides sixteen shades of
        grey, but Connectix plans to produce a color model later in
        1995 if the initial unit sells well. It's perfect for
        videoconferencing, learning how to make QuickTime movies,
        or even taking still greyscale snapshots.</p>

        <p>Two applications come with the camera, one for creating
        QuickTime movies and the other for capturing still
        pictures. The former can combine the camera's digital video
        signal with sound input, using your Mac's microphone (if it
        has one) or the microphone built into the QuickCam itself.
        Connectix recommends you use the Mac's microphone given the
        choice; QuickCam's isn't particularly high quality, and
        using it limits the bandwidth available in the serial cable
        for video signal. Also included with the QuickCam is a
        picture framing utility and an After Dark-compatible screen
        saver module. QuickCam owners who return their registration
        card will receive a CD-ROM containing sample video files
        and additional utilities.</p>

        <p>Speaking of video signal, Connectix has bypassed the
        loss of picture quality inherent in the process of
        converting analog video to digital signals. QuickCam
        generates a pure digital signal and sends it straight
        through to the QuickTime software running on the Mac.
        Camcorders and most other video cameras send out an analog
        NTSC video signal that then must be converted into digital
        information before the Mac can use it. This conversion can
        (especially with cheaper equipment) result in jitters,
        snow, or other degradation in quality. QuickCam avoids all
        this.</p>

        <p>Are there any practical uses for a QuickCam so far?
        Absolutely. Even if you don't consider four-bit greyscale
        sufficient for your next cinematic masterpiece, it's plenty
        for videoconferencing on even low-bandwidth networks like
        LocalTalk or medium-bandwidth connections to the Internet.
        Cornell University's freeware CU-SeeMe videoconferencing
        application (designed specifically to use TCP/IP protocols
        as found on the Internet) now supports QuickCam. Since
        CU-SeeMe is also limited to 16 shades of grey, it's a match
        made in heaven.</p>

        "ftp://cu-seeme.cornell.edu/pub/video/">ftp://cu-seeme.cornell.edu/pub/video/</a></p>

        <p>In addition, Connectix is working on QuickCard, a
        utility designed to let people easily make multimedia
        greeting cards, complete with audio and video from the
        QuickCam and other embellishments provided by
        QuickCard.</p>

        <p>A QuickCam certainly won't make you the next Fellini,
        but for about a hundred bucks, it's an easy investment to
        justify even if you just want to play around. For

           URL?
        <br />
        Alex Morando</b></p>

        <p>As you may have noticed in the previous article, there
        are weird references that look like this:</p>

        <p><a href=
        "http://ase15.tor.allied.com/www/home/AES_home_page.html"><b>
        http://ase15.tor.allied.com/www/home/AES_home_page.html</b></a></p>

        <p>What are these "things?". They are called Uniform
        Resource Locators (URLs). A URL defines a files location on
        the world-wide Internet and is the basis upon which the
        World Wide Web (WWW) operates. You may be more familiar
        with one Internet program used to browse the Web:
        Mosaic.</p>

        <p>Suffice it to say that the URL defines three things: the
        <b>protocol</b> used to retreive the file, the
        <b>machine</b> on which the file resides, and the
        <b>name</b> of the file, including its <b>path</b> within
        the machine. The most common protocol is HyperText
        Transport Protocol (http), currently the dominant method
        used to retreive files on the WWW. Thus, the URL above
        refers to a HyperText Transport Protocol document, located
        at the machine ase15.tor.allied.com, in the directory path
        /www/home, with a filename of AES_home_page.html.</p>

        <p>The following article is one person's viewpoint on the
        importance of URLs in defining the future direction of the
        Internet.</p>

        Gerard Martin &lt;<a href=
        "mailto:martin@usl.edu">martin@usl.edu</a>&gt;</b></p>

        <p>It has been suggested that the metaphor of an
        information superhighway is weak and tired. After all, how
        many of us live on a four-lane interstate? An alternative
        metaphor for this speedily growing twenty-first century
        infrastructure is that of a space: space for what will
        amount to a living repository of living data, live data
        about more living data, and - as a process - active
        participation in the lives of many people.</p>

        <p>In William Shatner's "TekWar," a counter-culture
        knowledge worker asserts that he lives "in there" as he
        points to the computer workstation that "gateways" to his
        world. William Gibson first gave us the word "cyberspace"
        for a machine-created space in his depiction of a world in
        which one dwells and - we assume - where one stores many,
        many things. Few today profess to living in cyberspace, yet
        some of us log incredible hours online. Therefore, it
        cannot be for naught that the Internet has been labeled by
        one recent news magazine as the "hang-out" of the nineties,
        a soda- fountain of good reading and good conversation, a
        regular ethereal haven of new vibes.</p>

        <p>The Internet blossomed on the day when "browsing the
        World-Wide Web" gave "cruising the net" a whole new
        meaning. For me, the transition began when our system
        administrator added the University of Kansas Lynx hypertext
        browser to our Internet programs. Long before experiencing
        the multimedia sensation of Mosaic, MacWeb, or Netscape, I
        recognized something that I had needed for a long time - a
        stable addressing protocol. Despite long-standing efforts
        with the FTP/Archie and the Gopher/Veronica/Jughead systems
        to connect users to files, resources could come and go in a
        way that defied anyone's attempt sustain the metaphor of a
        global data repository. I once described the Internet as a
        library where each day introduced new titles while old
        titles were removed from dustier virtual shelves. That more
        titles were being added than removed proved little solace
        when I received a "Resource Not Found" message.</p>

        <p>The day that saw the introduction of the more stable URL
        (Uniform/Universal Resource Locator) helped change this
        forever. Since then, the very description of "uniform" is
        often replaced by the promise of "universal" in a way that
        strengthens the dream of open-system document addressing.
        It should come as little surprise that Forbes Magazine
        would suggest the dissolution of Dewey Decimal System:
        imagine every infinitely retrievable document or document
        entry with its own unique Internet-resident address.</p>

        <p>For years, people criticized the Internet for its lack
        of a glossary-style index of cross-references. The Internet
        as encyclopedia was a poor choice of metaphors. Such a
        global task at one time seemed unapproachable. Yet, no one
        questioned that this Internet of networked computers
        **could** serve as a suitable dwelling for digital
        materials of, at the very least, alpha- numerical
        potential. However, beyond the conduit and the content
        there was the inevitable loss of context. Fortunately, the
        client/server paradigm slowly began to make sense of it
        all.</p>

        <p>We have all seen stereotypical, dystopian
        end-of-the-world scenes of desolation and disaster: the
        most haunting visions are those of empty highways devoid of
        people and traffic. We all somehow know that this is not
        the world in which we want to live. Fortunately, the
        traffic on the Internet carries - with the increasing
        volume of participants and their resources - an
        increasingly high density of "URL embeddedness." I connect
        my data to yours and you connect yours to mine - already
        two points of access and reference exist for readers
        everywhere. Of course, this has profound implications for
        the emerging issue of network document copyright
        legislation. When the very act of browsing precipitates a

        <p>Clearly, a metaphor that attempts to encompass both a
        community and its resources will supersede a metaphor that
        seeks only to extend transit. This is the claim to
        universality made by those trading documents using the URL
        resource-labeling system. For those who have experienced
        hot-text and clickable fields, the seamlessness can be
        utterly amazing. Where Gutenberg's press introduced the
        medium of movable type, the World-Wide Web begins to plug
        more than molten lead into the spaces that will connect our
        worlds together.</p>

        <p><b>Apple's Record Revenues, 1 Million Power Macs
        Shipped</b></p>

        <p>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1995 JAN 20 (NB) -- Apple
        Computer, Inc. has reported record revenues, and earnings
        for its first fiscal quarter, which ended December 30,
        1994. The "teenage" personal computer maker also announced
        that it has shipped its one millionth Power Macintosh
        computer or upgrade based on the PowerPC
        microprocessor.</p>

        <p>Company spokesperson Eric Wee told Newsbytes these
        shipment of 1 million Power Macintosh systems or upgrades
        is quite an accomplishment. Wee points out only 10 months
        have passed since the introduction of Power Macintosh
        systems and sales have well exceeded forecasts by Apple and
        by industry analysts. Wee told Newsbytes there are now 450
        Power Macintosh applications shipping which have been
        optimized to take full advantage of the high performance of
        the reduced instruction set computer (RISC)-based Power
        Macintosh system.</p>

        <p>In commenting about Apple shipping its 1 millionth Power
        Macintosh system/upgrade, Michael Spindler, Apple's
        president and chief executive officer, said, "Apple took
        the lead," in 1994 "bringing RISC technology to mainstream
        personal computing." According to Spindler, "We (Apple)
        embarked on a major transition in our business." Spindler
        also said that the one million unit milestone is "a
        testament to our (Apple) customers' acceptance of Power
        Macintosh as their platform for the future, and to Apple's
        ability to deliver on its objectives."</p>

        <p>Apple expects its revenues to grow as MacOS licensees
        get their products to market and systems based on the new
        PowerPC common hardware platform jointly developed by
        Apple, IBM and Motorola, also are produced. This hardware
        platform announced in November 1994 is intended to be
        capable of running multiple operating systems, including
        the Macintosh OS, Warp/OS2, and Windows NT.</p>

        <p>Company spokesperson Lynne Lawler told Newsbytes the
        "improved earnings were the result of strong revenue growth
        combined with higher gross margins as a percentage of net
        sales." Lawler added gross margins improved to 28.7% of net
        sales in the first quarter of fiscal 1995 from 24.0% of net
        sales in the same period a year ago. Lawler attributes the
        increase in gross margins primarily to the introduction and
        sale of new higher margin products, including Power
        Macintosh computers.</p>

        <p><b>Motorola Rings in 1995 With the Launch of the
        Marco(TM) Wireless Communicator</b></p>

        <p><i>MACWORLD Attendees Get First Look at the World's Only
        Newton-Based Integrated Wireless Hand-Held Device</i></p>

        <p>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- January 4, 1995 Today at
        MACWORLD, Motorola's Wireless Data Group (WDG) introduced
        the Marco Wireless Communicator, the first wireless
        communications device based on Apple's Newton platform, the
        industry's leading hand-held operating platform. The Marco
        Wireless Communicator integrates two- way, wide-area
        wireless communications into the Newton platform and
        operates on ARDIS, the industry's premier wireless data
        communications network.</p>

             height="255"
             naturalsizeflag="3"
             align="left" />Without plugging in to a phone line,
             the Marco device allows users to exchange messages
             with their workgroups and the Internet, access company
             or industry-specific information using custom wireless
             applications, send wireless messages to fax machines
             and receive wireless news and stock market updates.
             This product is ideal for mobile professionals and
             users in</p>

        <p>specialized markets including sales automation, real
        estate, healthcare, financial services and field
        service.</p>

        <p><br clear="all" />
        <b>Marco Communication Network and Services</b></p>

        <p>The Marco communicator currently runs on the ARDIS
        network, the world's leading wireless data communications
        network. ARDIS provides on-street, in-vehicle and
        in-building coverage to 90 percent of the business areas in
        the United States. This includes 400 metropolitan areas
        including 10,700 cities and towns. Motorola intends to
        expand its support to include other networks, including RAM
        Mobile Data and CDPD, based on customer feedback.</p>

        <p>For wireless messaging, the Marco Wireless Communicator
        will be available with both RadioMail and ARDIS
        PersonalMessaging services. Users can sign up to have both
        services, or choose just one.</p>

        <p><b>[The Marco can run hundreds of applications now
        available for the Apple Newton and Sharp ExpertPad
        PDAs]</b></p>

        <p><b>Design and Specifications</b></p>

        <p>The Marco Wireless Communicator's ergonomic design
        allows it to fit conveniently into a briefcase, handbag or
        compact carrying case. The Marco product weighs 1.8 pounds
        and is 7.5 inches high, 5.8 inches wide and 1.4 inches
        deep. The device features a portrait screen that is bright
        and crisp to allow easy reading in many lighting
        conditions. The pen is carefully weighted to feel more like
        a traditional pen. The edges are tapered and the casing is
        dark to allow the unit to survive the wear and tear of
        constant use.</p>

        <p>The Marco device provides users with 1MB of internal
        memory and a PCMCIA Type II slot for memory expansion,
        software flexibility and access to wireline fax modem and
        other peripherals. Communication between devices is also
        supported via a Newton-compatible infrared port. Connection
        to the desktop or to printers is handled via an
        Appletalk-compatible serial port. The device features a
        NiCad battery that provides users with up to eight hours of
        run time.</p>

        <p><b>Pricing, Distribution and Availability</b></p>

        <p>The street price of the Marco device is likely to range
        from $900 to $1,400, depending upon the system bundle that
        users choose. Prices for peripherals are set by their
        respective vendors and Motorola envisions a wide range of
        services with different pricing structures.</p>

        <p>The Marco device will be available in January 1995. Some
        of the initial dealers are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>J&amp;R ComputerWorld, New York, New York</li>

          <li>Newton Source, New York, New York</li>

          <li>Totally Wireless, San Jose, California</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>

        <p><b>July 31, 1995 -</b> All 68K desktop machines and

        <ul>
          <li>PowerMac 5300/75
          <br />
          <br />
          Redesigned 575-style machine, Looks like a Multiple Scan
          15 with a little extra trim on the bottom to accommodate
          a mother board, floppy slot, etc. This is the first 603e
          machine and will be available at first for K-12 only.
          <br />
          <br />
          603e @ 75Mhz, IDE internal hard drive, 1 PCI slot, not
          upgradeable to other processors, $1,500
          <br /></li>

          <li>PowerMac 6300/75
          <br />
          <br />
          630-style case, 603e @ 75Mhz (possibly a 601 instead),
          IDE internal hard drive, 1 PCI slot, not upgradeable to
          other processors, $1,200
          <br /></li>

          <li>PowerMac 7150/80 [TNT]
          <br />
          <br />
          New-style cross 630/7100 case, 601 @ 80Mhz [possibly
          100Mhz], 3 PCI slots, 1 DAV, 1 Video-PCI, $2,000
          <br /></li>

          <li>PowerMac 8400/100 [Nitro]
          <br />
          <br />
          8100 case, 604 @ 100Mhz [possibly 120Mhz], 3 PCI slots, 1
          DAV, 1 Video-PCI, $3,000</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All the new Macs will be using the fabled dynamic
        compilation emulator that we've heard so much about. So
        this means that TNT (601@80MHz) will be emulating at
        something like 2-3x the speed of your stock 8100/80.
        Emulation on the 604s will feel like native code running on
        a 6100/60 or better. Until Intel releases their P6 machines
        (or 200MHz Pentiums) it looks very clear that Apple's 604s
        (Nitro and Tsunami) will be the fastest mainstream desktop
        offerings. By far.</p>

        <p>And given what rumblings I've heard about the positive
        604 yields, and other things, it looks like Apple will soon
        ramp up everything (except PowerBooks) to the 604. The 604
        seems like it's going to be the processor of choice until
        we get a clear successor (nobody seems to think that the
        620 will go into desktops). Anyway, enough speculation. If
        there are updates... I'll post what I find. All prices are
        ApplePrices, expect a 10-15% reduction for actual prices
        from your local store.</p>
