        <h2>The End ... of the Dark Ages?</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p><a href="../97q4/97q4.html">One year ago</a>, this
          newsletter was titled "The End?"</p>

          <p>What a difference a year makes. I recall challenging
          someone a day's salary that Apple won't go out of
          business during the Dark Ages of Windows95. I should have
          bet a week's salary, but I wouldn't have bet my Apple
          stock!</p>
          <hr align="left" />

          <p>Unfortunately, many large companies that have the
          resources and ability to distinguish themseleves from
          each other, have failed to do so. Many IS departments
          remain very hostile to non-Windows platforms and continue
          to drive productivty and users' morale down by
          standardizing on inefficient methods and policies.</p>

          <p>However, many corporate users, both IS and non-IS
          staff, have begun to "Think Different", not only by
          looking at the MacOS, but towards the concept of <a href=
          "http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a>, embodied by
          the rise of the Linux operating system and powerful
          software like <b>Apache</b>, <b>Mozilla</b>, and <b>GNU
          egcs</b>. I believe that Open Source is a way of
          computing that will eventually free us from the
          overreaching control of IS administrators whose quest for
          the their bottom line means taking from others' bottom
          line. If properly developed, Open Source software and
          commercial software can co-exist in a computing world
          whose purpose is to let users do their job in the most
          efficient and cost-effective way possible, without
          suffering from the control of any single company or
          department, whether it be Microsoft, AOL, and yes, even
          Apple.</p>
          <hr align="left" />

          <p>Despite still-gloomy news from the depths of the
          Fortune 500, 1998 has been a good year for Apple. MacOS
          8.1 was released early this year, as Apple continued to
          cut costs and make money following its surprise $44
          million profit. During the last Developer's Conference,
          Apple announced MacOS X - an operating system that helps
          transition the MacOS into a powerful, stable, and
          sophisticated operating system. Based on NeXT technology,
          X promises to leapfrog all other operating systems when
          it is released sometime next year.</p>

          <p>The big event came in mid-May, when the iMac was
          announced. Althought not the most powerful computer at
          the time it was introduced, it nevertheless captured
          peoples' imagination.</p>

          <p><b>Finally, those outside the MacOS world began to
          realize that computing was more than just megahertz,
          gigabytes, and T1 connectivity. Computing is an integral
          part of daily life, filled with intangibles like soul,
          passion, and just plain fun. Of all the computers out
          there, the iMac comes closest to the concept of an
          "organic" computer - a computer that does not look
          different from all the other things we have around the
          house, and something we see as a natural part of our
          everyday activities. Windows doesn't even come
          close.</b></p>
          <hr align="left" />

          <p>As the year wound down, Apple introduced speed-bumped
          versions of it's desktop Power Macintosh G3 series, much
          improved PowerBook G3 computers (all with 14-inch active
          matrix displays), MacOS 8.5 with Sherlock user-based
          search engine, and the impending releases of MacOS X
          Server and WebObjects, possibly the best custom
          development environments bar none.</p>

          <p>So here we are, on the eve of another Macworld. Apple
          is not out of the woods yet, but 1999 promises to be even
          better than 1998. With continued profitability, Apple is
          poised to increase their investment in upcoming
          technologies, supporting the development of consumer
          portables, set-top boxes, licensing (<b>gasp</b>)
          software from/to third parties, and selling even more
          innovative products.</p>

          <p>Let's hope that a Renaissance awaits our favorite
          computer company.</p>
