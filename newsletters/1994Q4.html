        <br />
        Alex Morando, AES Engineering
        <br /></b></p>

        <p>18 months ago, Claris released a version of their
        FileMaker Pro database with scripting capabilities. It is a
        subset of <b>AppleScript</b>, an system extension that
        allows multiple applications to work together and allow the
        user to integrate them for his or her specific needs. In
        many respects, it is a batch language similar to that used
        on PCs, but is also an entire programming language with a
        great deal of power.</p>

        <p><b>Software Development Folders</b></p>

        <p>AppleScript was used in AES Space Systems Engineering to
        create a prototype Software Development Folder (SDF). It
        offered features and capabilities not possible with the
        current paper-based SDF.</p>

        <p>An SDF tracks the development of a software engineering
        program. It tracks requirements, project milestones, actual
        program files, diagrams, and test/qualification results. It
        is used to verify that the software is developed correctly
        and within customer specifications.</p>

        <p>Before this project, an SDF was just a manila folder
        with separate sections, each section being handwritten or
        printed separately. The basic problem is that the
        relationship between what is in the SDF and what software
        is actually being written is out-of-date at best, uncertain
        at worst.</p>

        <p>In designing the prototype, FileMaker Pro was selected
        to contain the various sections in the SDF. A database
        application made sense since each SDF section contained
        redundant information, such as SDF name, dates, assigned
        serial number, and schedule milestones. Different layouts
        were used to recreate each page so that it looked like the
        original paper-only SDF. Fields were added to reference the
        various documents, customer changes, technical milestones,
        comments, and other required SDF information. One layout
        was used to create a central reference to the SDF, similar
        to a Table of Contents.</p>

        <p><b>Enter AppleScript</b></p>

        <p>This is where AppleScript comes into play. Ada source
        code (text files) and data flow diagrams (Postscript files)
        had to be correlated. These files could have been imported
        into FileMaker Pro as text and picture fields, but that
        would have dramatically increased database size and would
        result in having multiple copies of the source code and
        diagrams. Thus, it was decided to keep the source code as
        separate text files and the diagrams in a separate
        FileMaker database. So how can a person looking at the
        original SDF be able to access the source code text and
        diagrams (in another file)?</p>

        <p>The diagrams was easy - use a script. It would take the
        unit identifier for the software, copy it, open the diagram
        database, and do a search based on that unit identifier.
        The diagram would then pop up soon after the user clicks on
        the "Block Diagram" button (Figure 1). The corresponding
        script is shown in Figure 2:</p>

        <p align="center"><b>Figure 2 - FileMaker Pro Script
        Examples</b></p>

        <p align="center"></p>

        <p>To open source code files was similar: take the current
        serial number for the software, and instruct the Finder to
        open a file based on the serial number. The AppleScript
        that does this is listed in Figure 3. It's very easy to
        understand, since AppleScript is a loosely-typed language -
        there are multiple ways to accomplish the same thing and
        the syntax is English-like.</p>

        <p>Instead of telling what program to open, the Finder
        simply tells the file to open itself. Thus, it doesn't
        matter what program created the file; the right one will
        always be opened. However, since this was implemented on
        both Macs and PCs, the default file extension is *.ASC to
        allow automatic opening by Windows programs.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>Figure 3 - AppleScript Example</b></p>

        <p><b>The Bottom Line</b></p>

        <p>This FileMaker database prototype took four days to
        conceptualize, implement, and debug. Both the Mac and
        Windows version of the SDF were implemented simultaneously.
        It is very robust and was well received by those in charge
        of SDF maintenance. In addition, with the security features
        built into FileMaker, there is now a closer relationship
        between what we say and what we do, in the spirit of
        IPDS</p>

        <p><b>Introduction to Email on the Internet</b></p>

        <p>Everybody wants to use the Internet these days and the
        one thing that everybody can do on the Internet is send
        email. Electronic Mail is the first of 4 rivers of
        information on the Internet (see page 18 of Adam Engst's
        book <b>Internet Starter Kit</b> for the other three). For
        some people, the amount of time the Net requires sours
        their experience with it. The one thing that keeps most
        users checking the Net is electronic mail.</p>

        <p>There are a number of <b>ways to access the
        Internet</b>, including Email Gateways (like Compuserve and
        America On Line provide), Command Line Access (from a Unix
        machine), UUCP access, and as Adam Engst calls it "the
        cream of the crop" MacTCP access. It is possible to use the
        command-line access from your favorite Unix workstation,
        using the "mail" command. But, if you don't like typing
        long strings of commands or remembering cryptic Unix
        abbreviations, there is MacTCP access with the Macintosh
        graphical interface.</p>

        <p>If you have <b>MacTCP</b> correctly installed and are
        connected via a network or dial up phone line with a modem
        to an Internet provider, you can use one of the cool MacTCP
        Email programs like Eudora, LeeMail, Iride, POPmail,
        TechMail, BlitzMail and probably countless others.</p>

        <p>Many Macs at the company already have direct access to
        the Internet. If you can access a networked Unix
        workstation via MacTCP, your Mac is probably a node on the
        Internet. For example, my Internet address is
        keating@mac7.tor.allied.com. The Macintosh sitting on my
        office desktop is mac7. A good way to prove this is to try
        out an Email program, like LeeMail. One of the good things
        about an Email program is it doesn't appear to be affected
        by the introduction of the company's <b>Interlock
        Firewall</b>, that was activated on June 27.</p>

        <p>To use a dial up connection with a modem, in addition to
        MacTCP, you also have to have a SLIP (Serial Line Internet
        Protocol) or the newer PPP (Point to Point Protocol)
        account with an Internet provider if you want to run MacTCP
        aware applications with a Macintosh interface.</p>

        <p>It seems that the favorite TCP/IP aware Email software
        is Eudora, written by Steve Dorner. However, Eudora doesn't
        work on the company network, because it requires POP (Post
        Office Protocol) mail server. All we have is SMTP (Simple
        Mail Transfer Protocol) on our network. Enter
        <b>LeeMail</b>, which is an SMTP mailer.</p>

        <p>I have been using LeeMail for three months now, and it
        is another one of those programs that does one thing and
        does it very well. It uses only 256k of RAM and can be left
        running all of the time. I put it in my startup folder.
        LeeMail has audio notification of new mail; when mail
        arrives, it has it's own sound resource that is like a
        spoon striking a half full wine glass twice. I liked the
        sound so much, I used ResEdit to create a separate sound
        from it, which I added to my system file.</p>

        <p><b>How to Get LeeMail</b></p>

        <p><b>LeeMail is a shareware program</b>; if you like it,
        send a check for $25.00 to Lee Fyock, who wrote the
        program. The program can be found on the ASACMUG BBS on the
        Engineering KeyServer in the Software Library:Network
        folder. LeeMail comes with 17 pages of documentation
        written in Microsoft Word.</p>

        <p><b>How to Use LeeMail</b></p>

        <p>In the beginning, <b>to use LeeMail</b>, you have to go
        to the Edit menu and select Settings, which opens <b>the
        Preferences window</b>. Select the Mail Setup radio button
        and enter the following information. I will give the
        entries for my setup as examples.</p>

        <dl>
          <dt><tt>Your Mac's domain name
          mac7.tor.allied.com</tt></dt>

          <dt><tt>Your user ID keating</tt></dt>

          <dt><tt>Your full name Ron Keating</tt></dt>

          <dt><tt>Your address for replies
          keating@mac7.tor.allied.com</tt></dt>
        </dl>

        <p>Your user ID can be just about any alphanumeric string,
        and your full name is your "human" name, so that recipients
        will know who sent them mail. Next, select Outgoing Mail
        Options in Preferences. My entries are as follows:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt><tt>X Use mail router</tt></dt>

          <dt><tt>Router domain name ase.tor.allied.com</tt></dt>

          <dt><tt>X Binhex TEXT enclosures</tt></dt>

          <dt><tt>Limit TCP packet size</tt></dt>

          <dt><tt>X CC to self</tt></dt>

          <dt><tt>Use [80] columns in window</tt></dt>

          <dt><tt>X Add signature</tt></dt>
        </dl>

        <p>The signature button in Outgoing Mail Options lets you
        set the text to be appended to your outgoing mail. For
        example, I use sometimes use the following signature,
        although I often change it:</p>

        <p>There are still more windows in Preferences for Incoming
        Mail Options, General Options, Notify Options, and POP
        options; these should be self explanatory.</p>

        <p>One other setting is very important if you want to send
        mail: the <b>Domain Name Server</b> information in the
        MacTCP Administrator dialog box must be correctly entered.
        To check if this information has been entered, open the
        MacTCP control panel and click on More to see the
        Administrator dialog box. To set the information in the
        Administrator dialog box, you need "full configuration
        authority." You can get this authority if you have AdminTCP
        in your Control Panels in the System Folder. Open the Admin
        TCP control panel, select more, and remove the X in the
        Protected box. Then set the Domain Name Server information.
        My setting is as follows:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt><tt>Domain IP Address</tt></dt>

          <dt><tt>tor.allied.com 131.127.119.10</tt></dt>
        </dl>

        <p>If you don't have Admin TCP, or you don't know your
        Domain Name Server, you will have to see your network
        system administrator. It's a good idea to make a copy of
        the MacTCP files, before making any changes. There are four
        files that are important: MacTCP Prep in the Preferences
        folder, MacTCP and AdminTCP in the Control Panels folder,
        and MacTCP DNR in the System Folder. You can copy the hosts
        file in the System Folder too. All of the settings are
        saved in the MacTCP Prep file, so this is the most
        important one to save.</p>

        <p><b>LeeMail has a lot of nice features</b>. LeeMail
        supports aliases; selecting Aliases from the Edit menu
        gives the Aliases window. This lets you associate a simple
        name with the long string of text that comprises each
        Internet address, so that you don't have to type the
        address every time you send mail. When you are done with
        LeeMail, it automatically hides its windows when you click
        on any other part of the desktop. LeeMail can be set up to
        save all of your incoming messages and all of your outgoing
        messages to files that are easily accessed from the
        program. It also supports auto-quote text when replying to
        messages.</p>

        <p><b>If LeeMail isn't running, when Email arrives</b>, the
        local SMTP server saves the Email file. Then, when you
        launch LeeMail or boot up your Mac, the server sends the
        Email file to LeeMail, which then stores it on the Mac's
        hard drive in the LeeMail Files folder.</p>

        <p>In addition to sending text messages, LeeMail can be
        used to send and receive <b>binary files</b>. Binary files
        can be sent as enclosures or simply copied into the text
        message. LeeMail enclosures are sent in <b>BinHex</b>
        format, which is a 7 bit ASCII representation of an 8 bit
        binary file and is widely used on the Internet by the Mac
        world. You can BinHex a file with AutoBinHex and you can
        deBinHex a file with StuffIt Expander, both of which are
        freeware and available on the Engineering KeyServer in
        Torrance. You can use BBEdit to open a BinHex file and
        paste it into email text. You can extract a BinHexed file
        from email text, by recognizing that it starts with a blank
        line, followed by a message "(This file must be converted
        with BinHex 4.0)" and another blank line. The ASCII text
        between the two colons is the BinHexed file. Copy this and
        paste it into a new BBEdit file. To convert to the original
        binary file, use StuffIt Expander to extract the original
        from the saved BBEdit file. Sometimes, a long file greater
        than 20k may be broken up into parts at the receiving end.
        In this case, to restore the original file, copy each of
        the parts into BBEdit in turn to reassemble the original
        BinHexed file.</p>

           Software
        <br />
        Roger Wright, AES Engineering</b></p>

        <p><b>What Is It?</b></p>

        <p>VirtualDisk is a small Control Panel system extension to
        help you produce and update an on-line catalog of all your
        floppy disks and other removable media that you use with
        your Macintosh.</p>

        <p><b>The Problem:</b></p>

        <p>After a few years of using a Macintosh -- both at work
        and at home -- I've accumulated well over a hundred floppy
        disks, which I have used for a variety of purposes. Some of
        these disks contain backup material of many types; some
        contain files of shareware, freeware, bulletin board
        discussions, etc.; and some of them have been used to
        transport data between my work and home computers. The
        problem: how do I find a particular item that I know I put
        on a floppy x weeks ago, but now can't remember which
        one?</p>

        <p>[At this point, I should mention that I'm not talking
        about backup disks for various applications, such as
        Microsoft Word, MacDraw Pro, etc. These are neatly labeled
        and placed in special file boxes, where they are easily
        retrieved. I'm not interested in the contents of these
        disks, just what they are (e.g., <i>Install 1</i>).]</p>

        <p>Up to now, I've found no satisfactory means of
        cataloging my many floppies. At one point, I started a
        project to produce tables of contents of all my floppies.
        This involved inserting each disk into the Mac, choosing
        <b>View by Name</b> and opening all folders on the disk,
        and then getting a printout using the Finder's <b>Print
        Window...</b> command. The idea was to have a loose-leaf
        binder to contain all these tables of contents. I managed
        to do only 5 to 6 disks before the tedium of the process
        killed it.</p>

        <p>Besides, I realized that to search for a particular item
        would still require a bit of effort on my part, even if I
        had carefully categorized the table of contents in the
        notebook. And suppose I was at work and the notebook was at
        home.</p>

        <p><b>The Solution: Virtual Disk</b></p>

        <p>VirtualDisk is a utility by Continuum Software of
        Portland, Oregon which does a super job of producing, and
        keeping on-line, the contents of all removable media which
        pass through your Macintosh. It does this in a completely
        painless, and nearly automatic manner. (For purposes of
        discussion, we'll use the term floppy, but the operation is
        the same for all removable media; Syquest or Bernoulli
        cartridges, etc.).</p>

        <p><b>How the Cataloging Works</b></p>

        <p>When you first load VirtualDisk, it creates a 1 MB file
        called VirtualDisk Catalog in the Preferences File in your
        System Folder. This file is large enough to catalog about
        8000 files; it will expand automatically as more and more
        floppies (or other removable media) are included.</p>

        <p>The way VirtualDisk works is very simple: When you eject
        a floppy, VirtualDisk will save the disk's directory in its
        Catalog. In practice, I've found you want to set the "Ask
        First" preference as opposed to the "Always Catalog". When
        you eject a floppy that has not been previously cataloged,
        VirtualDisk, under "Ask First", will present you with a
        dialog asking if you want to catalog this disk. There are
        many times you don't want that particular disk cataloged;
        simply click on "Don't Catalog", or press the <b>esc</b>
        key, and the disk ejects. If you want to catalog it, click
        on "Catalog" or press the <b>Return</b> key, and
        VirtualDisk will assign it a serial number, and in a few
        seconds will store the disk's directory.</p>

        <p>If the disk you are ejecting has already been cataloged,
        VirtualDisk will automatically scan its directory for any
        changes, and will appropriately update its Catalog file,
        and then eject the disk.</p>

        <p><b>How to Interrogate the VirtualDisk Catalog</b></p>

        <p>VirtualDisk automatically mounts a "volume" on your
        desktop -- its icon suggests a 22nd century power plant.
        When you double click on this icon, a window opens which
        contains the icons and names of all of the floppies which
        have been cataloged. This window can be viewed just like
        any other Finder window -- usually you'll want to <b>View
        by Name</b>. By double clicking a floppy icon, a new window
        will come up showing the contents of the floppy in the same
        style as if you had inserted the floppy and double clicked
        on it. (If you have turned on all of the VirtualDisk
        storage options, the window will be exactly the same as
        that of the floppy.)</p>

        <p>You can wander through the various floppy directories as
        you choose, using the normal Finder procedures. More
        important, however, is the ability of any <i>Find</i>
        utility (the Finder's own <b>Find...</b>, Norton Utilities
        <b>Fast Find</b>, etc.) to quickly scan the floppy
        directories and present you with its search list. Using it
        in this manner, you can quickly find out where you have
        stored copies of a special file or utility, and their
        creation dates, version numbers, etc. For example, I
        recently found several copies of PopChar on various disks,
        all of which were older than the latest version on the
        bulletin boards.</p>

        <p>If you double click on a particular file or application
        in one of the VirtualDisk windows, it will prompt you to
        insert the appropriate floppy.</p>

        <p><b>Miscellaneous Information</b></p>

        <p>Cataloging Non-Removable Media</p>

        <p>The manual says that you can force VirtualDisk to
        catalog any SCSI volume or Network volume by holding down
        the <b>Option</b> key while dragging the volume to the
        trash.</p>

        <p>Reducing Storage Used by the VirtualDisk Catalog</p>

        <p>There are a number of options which can be selected
        which will reduce the size of the VirtualDisk Catalog -- or
        allow more items to be cataloged in the original 1-MB
        catalog. These include storing only black-and-white icons
        instead of color ones, and limiting the types of files to
        be cataloged. There are certain exclusions to the catalog
        process which can be set up explicitly: for example, never
        to catalog a name like "TeachText".</p>

        <p>Use on Two Macintoshes</p>

        <p>The license agreement specifically limits the use of the
        product to one Macintosh. This means if you have a home
        computer and one at work, or a base Mac and a PowerBook,
        you cannot use VirtualDisk on both computers. The best
        tactic here would be to install it on the computer at the
        location where you keep most of your removable media. To
        keep the VirtualDisk Catalog up to date, you would
        transport updated floppies to the machine upon which
        VirtualDisk is loaded, and do the cataloging there.</p>

        <p>Other Utilities Included: DiskDup+ and EasyLabels</p>

        <p>Two other products are shipped with VirtualDisk. One
        product, DiskDup+ makes sector-by-sector copies of disks.
        Like Apple's Disk Copy 4.2, it can also be used to store
        disk images on a hard drive.</p>

        <p>Easy Labels is a disk labeling routine which can
        automatically produce a variety of diskette labels which
        include the disk name, its contents and the serial number
        which VirtualDisk has assigned to it. If you use the Avery
        5274 diskette label, the disk title and serial number will
        appear on the edge of the disk.</p>

        <p><b>Overall Opinion</b></p>

        <p>I highly recommend VirtualDisk to all Mac users. It has
        worked smoothly, quickly, and without any errors in the
        month that I have had it. The program greatly simplifies my
        handling of floppies, and I'm sure it would be appropriate
        for persons who have Syquest or Bernoulli cartridges.</p>

        <p>The Reference Manual is quite adequate, but it is
        published in a small 4.5 x 4.5 inch format. I like manuals
        to be larger so they are easier to put on a bookshelf, or
        include in a loose-leaf binder.</p>

        <p>The restriction of use to only one Macintosh I feel is a
        real limitation and should be liberalized by Continuum
        Software.</p>

        <p><b>Ordering Information</b></p>

        <p>VirtualDisk is produced by</p>

             7.5</font>
        <br />
        Alex Morando, AES Engineering</b>

        <p><b>System 7.5</b> was released by Apple Computer last
        September. Althought the suggested retail price is $99,
        there are many ways to get it cheaper - buy a Mac after
        August, 1994, upgrade an existing copy of System 7, or take
        advantage of the User Group Special offer for $49.</p>

        <p>I have been running 7.5 for the past three weeks on my
        PowerMac 6100. Overall, it has been more stable and faster
        than the previous version, but only if certain features are
        turned off. I found this disturbing since there are
        non-Apple utilities out there that can do the same job and
        yet keep your system stable and running at top speed.</p>

        <p>System 7.5 can be purchsed in floppy or CD-ROM versions.
        I strongly recommend the CD-ROM version, as it contains
        more extra software (a cool QuickTime movie and demo
        software). It might be a good reason to go and buy a CD-ROM
        drive now, since prices have fallen below $200 for the
        older models. You can also make backup disks with either
        version; this is useful when trying to install on a Mac
        wihtout a CD-ROM drive.</p>

        <p>There are three main installations of 7.5 - the <b>basic
        software</b> itself, <b>QuickDraw GX</b>, and
        <b>PowerTalk</b>. I have only installed the basic software
        and have no experience with either of the last two features
        except from what other people have told me. The memory
        requirements are as shown below. In reality, you probably
        need 8 megs of RAM for the basic system in order to run
        multiple applications, especially Microsoft Office.</p>

        <p>One interesting feature of 7.5 is the new <b>Memory
        Manager</b> -- applications use less memory if virtual
        memory or RAMDoubler is installed. This is due to the use
        of shared libraries which reduce memory requirements since
        programs can now share common operating system code instead
        of duplicating them.</p>

        <p>The following additions are part of System 7.5. The
        sections on QuickDraw GX and PowerTalk was obtained from
        other people who have more memory and who need to use the
        additional software.</p>

        <p><b>MacTCP/OpenTransport</b></p>

        <p>MacTCP allows Macs to communicate over a network using
        the TCP protocol. TCP is fast becoming the communications
        standard within corporate networks. Having MacTCP built-in
        is a smart move on Apple's part. It also will be PowerPC
        native.</p>

        <p><b>PC Exchange 2.0</b></p>

        <p>This control panel allows the Mac to mount DOS disks on
        the desktop, bypassing the cumbersome Apple File Exchange.
        Combined with Macintosh Easy Open, it opens DOS files by
        double-clicking on the file itself. No need to remember
        extensions or associate filenames as you would do on a
        PC.</p>

        <p><b>Drag Manager</b></p>

        <p>The new Drag Manager simplifies the way users transfer
        data between applications. Instead of cutting, switching to
        another application or document, and then pasting, users
        drag their selections from one window to another, even if
        it's in different applications. Selections can also be
        dragged to the Finder, where it will be stored as a
        'clipping', ready to be dragged into any other window. The
        Notepad and Scrapbook that come with 7.5 shows how useful
        this feature can be.</p>

        <p><b>QuickTime 2.0</b></p>

        <p>Version 2.0 of QuickTime features faster frame rates (a
        Quadra 605 can now play VGA movies at 30 frames per
        second), support for MIDI and other notational formats, and
        support for high-end features used in video - MPEG and
        SMPTE.</p>

        <p><b>Apple Guide</b></p>

        <p>Balloon Help hasn't been successful among Mac
        developers. Apple hopes that Apple Guide will be better.
        Developers can write online documentation which lets help
        be given when appropriate. For example, if a user
        constantly chooses Copy from the Edit menu, Apple Guide
        will come up and suggest that cmd-C be used to save time. A
        more complicated task might be accompanied by cues and
        redlines (on the screen) to guide the user through the
        steps needed to accomplish his task. Audio help will be
        available on high-end Macs.</p>

        <p><b>Mac Easy Open</b></p>

        <p>Easy open uses XTND to translate files from one format
        to another. This lets users open another persons' file
        without having to have that person's application. For
        example, if a Photoshop user receives a PICT file created
        by Canvas, Easy Open will allow that file to be opened by
        Photoshop.</p>

        <p><b>Scriptable Finder</b></p>

        <p>The scriptable Finder is a long-delayed product which
        was supposed to have been shipped with AppleScript in 1993.
        This allows the Finder to be controlled by scripts to
        automate file management tasks like backup and
        organization.</p>

        <p><b>QuickDraw GX</b></p>

        <p>This is Apple's new way of handling graphics, both
        on-screen and off-screen. It brings capabilities previously
        found only in high-end graphics products to the operating
        system level. It supports gradients, enhanced masking,
        advanced transformation, and other improvements a graphics
        professional would love. The new printing architecture
        allows users to select printers and other output devices
        without the Chooser. Files are printed by dragging them to
        a printer icon on the desktop. Other features include
        moving print jobs from one printer to another by dragging
        icons, allocating large print jobs between different
        printers, restarting an interrupted job without going back
        to page 1, and many other features to simplify printing on
        the Mac. In addition, it is PowerPC native. For those who
        do not need GX, regular QuickDraw will still be supported
        and improved.</p>

        <p><b>PowerTalk</b></p>

        <p>PowerTalk is a communications extension that gives Macs
        built-in email and scheduling. Documents (or parts of
        documents) can be sent to other people or groups. A
        separate mail program or mail files are not necessary;
        everything can be done from a Mail command under the File
        menu. With Microsoft no longer developing Microsoft Mail,
        PowerTalk has been endorsed by both Apple and Microsoft as
        the next upgrade for Mail users.</p>

        <p>The following shareware and freeware utilities have
        become standard features of System 7.5. Apple either bought
        out the utility or wrote their own enhancements.</p>

        <table width="100%"

        <p>When I first installed 7.5, I noticed that my Mac had
        slowed down noticeably. After a couple of hours of trial
        and error, I found out that the following features were
        hogging my memory and CPU power - <b>Apple Menu Options</b>
        and <b>Launcher</b>. Turning off these two made 7.5 as fast
        as my prevous system (7.0.1). I also found additional speed
        improvements when Apple Guide is turned off, since it has
        not been optimized for the Power Macintosh.</p>

        <p>[If you miss the features of <b>Apple Menu Options</b>,
        third-party utilities such as PopupFolder and Now Utilities
        5.0 can do the same thing with little or no slowdown.]</p>

        <p>Unless you need the advanced graphics capability of
        QuickDraw GX or the communications features of PowerTalk,
        installing these features is not recommended. However,
        graphics and art departments will probably want to install
        QDGX while business users may want to use PowerTalk, if the
        network is compatible.</p>

        <p>All in all, System 7.5 makes working with the Mac easier
        and to offer features to differentiate itself from PC
        compatibles. It is not a major step in terms of the
        internal workings of the Mac operating system. That
        supposedly will come with the release of System 8.0
        sometime in 1995.</p>

        <p>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1994 JUN 20 (NB) -- Apple
        Computer Macintosh users in the United States are being
        invited by Apple Computer to join its new online service,
        <b>eWorld</b>, which begins service today with close to
        12,000 members already online.</p>

        <p>According to Apple, eWorld will be a fully global online
        service offering local access numbers and local content for
        specific international areas within six months. As part of
        its continuing cross-platform commitment, Apple will
        welcome DOS/Windows users to eWorld sometime in 1995. Apple
        claims that the eWorld sftware is already included in most
        Apple computers being shipped this summer.</p>

        <p>Officially billed as "eWorld for Macintosh and
        NewtonMail, an eWorld messaging center for Newtons,"
        Apple's eWorld opens to a village of buildings, each
        labeled with a name to identify its content and a mail
        delivery truck to indicate the presence of e-mail.</p>

        <p><b>APPLE PREPARES 486DX COPROCESSOR CARD FOR POWER MAC
        6100 ONLY</b></p>

        <p>(November 4th 1994) Details are still sketchy, but as we
        went to press Apple was preparing to announce that another
        of its technology demonstrations - the 486 board for the
        Power Macintosh - has turned into a real product.</p>

        <p>We first reported on the board back in July (PowerPC
        News issue 9, story 1111) when Apple demonstrated a 50MHz
        486DX2 co-processor which let the Macintosh run Intel-based
        programs more efficiently than Insignia's Softwindows. The
        demonstration was an evolution of the 'Houdini' card which
        had previously been produced as a limited-run product for
        the Quadra 610. It featured improved networking support and
        SoundBlaster-compatible sound output.</p>

        <p>We understand that the finished product uses a 66MHz
        486DX-2 but that it will be limited to the Power Macintosh
        6100 only. From a marketing standpoint the decision looks
        curious, but an Apple source says that the limitation was
        forced on the company by the form-factor of the card and
        the fact that it needs to use the 6100's '040 slot . It
        still looks curious and means that the Power Mac 6100 will
        become the Macintosh of choice for those users who need to
        run Windows software fast and in protected mode. The upside
        is the price. Our guess is that it should appear in the US
        for something like $600 or $700. [Which makes a great
        upgrade option for Power Mac users who have to run DOS
        applications!]</p>

        <p>[Subsequent information indicates that the card will
        also work on the 7100 and 8100 Power Macintosh models, but
        Apple will not provide it as a bundled option. You have to
        buy the card separately and install it yourself by removing
        the HPV video card already present in the 7100/8100.]</p>
