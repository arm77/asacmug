## Allied-Signal Aerospace Company Macintosh Users Group

ASACMUG was a corporate user group serving employees of Allied-Signal Aerospace. Most of the members were located at the Allied-Signal facility in Torrance (California, US), although there were a few from Phoenix and Tucson (Arizona, US), South Bend (Indiana, US), and Teterboro (New Jersey, US)

In 1999, Honeywell was acquired by Allied-Signal, which then took on the more recognized Honeywell name. Today, Honeywell Aerospace maintains a presence in the above locations.

ASACMUG membership declined after Macs were phased out of the company after 1995. Attrition and retirements effectively ended the group by 2008. This web page serves as a memorial of its existence.
