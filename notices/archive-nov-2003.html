Alex was able to install Matlab on his G3 iBook and checked out a (time-limited) license. Macs can now be used for actual engineering technical work now that companies are taking advantage of the Unix environment to port their software.<br /><br />The ASACMUG Mailing list was moved to a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/asacmug" rel="self">new home at Yahoo! Groups</a>. Members can now post messages and hold discussions.<br /><br />Apple announced the G5 PowerMac in June. The Torrance Art Department received a single-CPU 1.8GHz Mac in October. Tesh successfully created the Torrance Engineering Town Hall movie in record time (Final Cut Express render time went from 4+ hours to less than 10 minutes).<br /><br />The stability and robustness of MacOS X was demonstrated when the entire Art Department was upgraded to Panther (10.3) within a month of the October 24th release date.<br /><br />The second annual <a href="http://www.macfair.org/" rel="external">MacFair</a> was held in Cerritos College in November. Mike, Alex, and Ming attended the event. <br /><br />Happy Holidays to all,<br />Alex<br /><h2>The Meeting</h2>As usual, we will be having our regular lunch/dinner get-togethers at Macworld.
