Roger has passed on to a better place, a place where Macs actually do rule.<br /><br />Apple continued to kick butt with their iPod and iTunes music platforms. Apple stock reaches a four-year high. Apple updates the entire Mac product line this year - the iBook and eMac break the sub-$1000 price barrier. Apple announced the G5 iMac at the end of August. Apple purchases by HoneyMUG members:<br /><UL>
<LI>iPod - Mike and Ron (iPod mini)
<LI>Power Mac G5 - Mike (dual 2.0GHz), Alex (dual 1.8GHz - DOA, returned to Apple in disgust)
<LI>iBook G4 - Matt
<LI>iMac G5 - Kevin (1.8GHz 20"), Alex (1.8GHz 17") 
</UL>
The Art Department had no problem getting approval to upgrade to an all-G5 tower setup. Unlike previous years, approval was quick and the budget was approved without any cuts. Could this be the long-awaited corporate acceptance of the Mac as a valid business machine?<br /><br />The third annual MacFair was held in Cerritos College in November. Only Alex attended this event. <br /><br />Happy Holidays to all,<br />Alex<br /><h2>The Meeting</h2>As usual, we will be having our regular lunch/dinner get-togethers at Macworld. The meetings will occur during all days of this years' show.<br /><br />The meeting times are<br /><br />    * January 11, 2005 between 1:00- 1:15pm<br />    * January 12, 2005 between 12:00-12:15pm<br />    * January 13, 2005 between 12:00-12:15pm<br />     * January 14, 2005 between 12:00-12:15pm <br /><br />    If you get lost, give ASACMUG a call:<br />    Alex Morando seven-one-four--four-eight-eight--fifty-four-ninety-three<br />    Mike Quan three-one-zero--four-six-three-twenty-seven-oh-eight</p></div></div>
