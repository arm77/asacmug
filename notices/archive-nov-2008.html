              <h2>2008 MUG / Apple highlights</h2>

              <p style="text-align:left;"><br />
              Mike, Tracy, Dick, and Alex attended MWSF 2008, where
              Apple introduced the MacBook Air - "the worlds
              thinnest notebook". Apple also announced iTunes movie
              rentals and an update to AppleTV, in an attempt to
              stay ahead of Microsoft on the road to the digital
              living room.
              <br />
              <br />
              Due to Apple's stock runup in 2007, it suffered
              greatly as the market and economy continued to absorb
              the bad news of the housing and credit crises. From a
              high of $200 near Macworld Expo 2008, the stock sank
              as low as $90 during the October market collapse.
              <br />
              <br />
              Apple introduced the iPhone 3G (twice the speed at
              half the price) one year after the first iPhone hit
              the streets. Demand was much higher for the iPhone 3G
              due to its worldwide release - Apple has sold over 10
              million iPhone 3Gs and is poised to become the best
              selling smartphone in the world by years' end. News
              on the Mac side suffred somewhat this year as Apple
              continued to focus on the iPhone product line - an
              October Apple event introduced new laptops.

              The ASACMUG web site was redesigned to account for
              the closure of the ASACMUG clubhouse at Yahoo!
              Groups. A new clubhouse forum was setup on a
              dedicated server but the only ones who signed up were
              Alex and a few crickets.

              <h2>The End</h2>Many times over the past 15 years, we
              have speculated the future of Apple and the Macintosh
              platform. Some years (1997 comes to mind) seemed to
                   presage the end of Macworld Expo, but the
                   incredible optimism of Macintosh users and Apple
                   kept the platform alive. Today, Apple is a
                   premier computer and media company - its
                   survival for at least the next few years seems
                   assured. However, one cannot say the same about
                   ASACMUG.
              <br />
              <br />
              ASACMUG was started in 1988 by a few dedicated
              employees (Kevin, Mike, Tracy, and Russell); the
              first meeting was held on November 15, 1988. I joined
              in 1990 as a regular member. Until 1995, we gained
              many members as the Mac mindshare within the company
              grew. However, soon after that, the company
              standardized on the Wintel platform and ASACMUG lost
              influence and members via attrition and neglect.
              <br />
              <br />
              By 2001, almost all of the standard Mac User Group
              benefits we had built up had disappeared - the
              software library, bulletin board, MUG discounts,
              visits by Apple representatives, and the newsletter.
              A core group of members kept the lunchtime meetings
              and information exchange about all things Apple. I
              maintained the online presence, but it was only
              updated annually with a Macworld Expo meeting notice
              and a short summary of the events of the year. After
              leaving the company in 2006, I was no longer part of
              the user group although I was able to post the 2008
              and 2009 meeting notices.
              <br />
              <br />
              This month marks the 20th anniversary of the first
              ASACMUG meeting and the 10th ASACMUG annual meeting
              notice -- there will be no further updates to this
              site. I will keep the site up as a historical archive
              and reminder of ASACMUG. Even though it was not
              successful in keeping Macs on the corporate desktop,
              it did what a MUG should do - provide support and
              information to its members. Should the group be
              revived in the future, I will transfer over all the
              contents of this website.
              <br />
              <br />
              Until then, I can be contacted via email, telephone,
              my blog, social networks, Macworld Expos, and in
              person.

              dinner schedules will be arranged during lunch for

              be arranged via private email and phone calls.

              meeting location is noted by a black circle.
