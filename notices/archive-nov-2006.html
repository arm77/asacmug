Most had not expected Apple to announce Intel Macs this early.<br /><br />The Mac mini was the next Intel Mac, announced in March, along with some iPod accessories I don't even care to remember.<br /><br />The Macbook was Intel'ized in May, with Apple adding a hefty $150 premium for the black version. I found the glossy screen to be excellent and much better than the previous matte screens.<br /><br />Apple's switch to Intel processors was completed in August when the professional Mac Pro was announced at the 2006 WWDC, one year after Steve Jobs announced the Intel switch.<br /><br />In September, Apple refreshed their entire iPod product line, which had not seen an update since 2005. Nevertheless, iPod continued to maintain their 75% market share. The 5G iPod had some minor updates, the nano now comes in colors, and the iPod Shuffle was the most radically designed.<br /><br />Apple continued their dominance of the online music business, as competition from Microsoft's underwhelming Zune player and other companies failed to dislodge the vertically-integrated combination of the iPod and the iTunes Music Store. The store now sells music, audiobooks, TV shows, iPod games, movies, and podcasts.<br /><br />Apple stock price hit a high of $80+ during last year's Macworld Expo, only to drop to the 60s for most of the year.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.macgathering.com/" rel="external">MacGathering</a> was held this spring, but ASACMUG geography and apathy prevailed.<br /><br />The fifth annual <a href="http://www.macfair.org/" rel="external">MacFair</a> was held in Cerritos College in November. Mike and Alex attended.<br /><br />Apple purchases by HoneyMUG members:<br /><UL>

<br />Happy Holidays to all,<br />Alex<br />Vice President Emeritus<br /><h2>The Meeting</h2>As usual, we will be having our regular lunch/dinner get-togethers at Macworld. The meetings will occur during all days of this years' show. This time, all meeting times are at 1pm to beat the lunch crowds.<br /><br />The meeting times are<br /><br />    * January 9, 2007 between 1:00-1:15pm<br />    * January 10, 2007 between 1:00-1:15pm<br />    * January 11, 2007 between 1:00-1:15pm<br />    * January 12, 2007 between 1:00-1:15pm <br /><br />    If you get lost, give ASACMUG a call:<br />    Alex Morando seven-one-four--four-eight-eight--fifty-four-ninety-three<br />    Mike Quan three-one-zero--four-six-three-twenty-seven-oh-eight<br /><br />To avoid confusion in the past with the ASCII-rendered location of the meeting place, we now have a NEW meeting place, on the NorthEast corner closer to the conference ballrooms. The picture is attached below; the meeting location is marked with a yellow circle and will be moved inside (opposite the doors and windows) in the event of rain. For reference, the OLD meeting location is noted by a black circle.<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="" width="700" height="366" src="newmeetlocation.jpg" /><br /></p></div></div>
